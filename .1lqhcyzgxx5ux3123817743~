The State of Greece from the earliest Times to the Commencement of the
Peloponnesian War


Thucydides, an Athenian, wrote the history of the war between the
Peloponnesians and the Athenians, beginning at the moment that it broke
out, and believing that it would be a great war and more worthy of
relation than any that had preceded it. This belief was not without its
grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every
department in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest
of the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed
doing so at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the
greatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but
of a large part of the barbarian world—I had almost said of mankind.
For though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more
immediately preceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly
ascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as
was practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that
there was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.

For instance, it is evident that the country now called Hellas had in
ancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations were
of frequent occurrence, the several tribes readily abandoning their
homes under the pressure of superior numbers. Without commerce, without
freedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more of
their territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of
capital, never planting their land (for they could not tell when an
invader might not come and take it all away, and when he did come they
had no walls to stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily
sustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they
cared little for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither
built large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness. The
richest soils were always most subject to this change of masters; such
as the district now called Thessaly, Boeotia, most of the Peloponnese,
Arcadia excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of Hellas. The
goodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular
individuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of
ruin. It also invited invasion. Accordingly Attica, from the poverty of
its soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never
changed its inhabitants. And here is no inconsiderable exemplification
of my assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no
correspondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war
or faction from the rest of Hellas took refuge with the Athenians as a
safe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the
already large population of the city to such a height that Attica
became at last too small to hold them, and they had to send out
colonies to Ionia.

There is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my
conviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war
there is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of
the universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time
of Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the
country went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the
Pelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in
Phthiotis, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one
by one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of
Hellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten
itself upon all. The best proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born
long after the Trojan War, he nowhere calls all of them by that name,
nor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis,
who were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans,
Argives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian,
probably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest
of the world by one distinctive appellation. It appears therefore that
the several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first
acquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other,
but also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole
people, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength
and the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective
action.

Indeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained
increased familiarity with the sea. And the first person known to us by
tradition as having established a navy is Minos. He made himself master
of what is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the Cyclades,
into most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians
and appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to put
down piracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues
for his own use.

For in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and
islands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to
turn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives
being to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They would
fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere
collection of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be
the main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to
such an achievement, but even some glory. An illustration of this is
furnished by the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the
continent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we
find the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of
voyagers—“Are they pirates?”—as if those who are asked the question
would have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their
interrogators of reproaching them for it. The same rapine prevailed
also by land.

And even at the present day many of Hellas still follow the old
fashion, the Ozolian Locrians for instance, the Aetolians, the
Acarnanians, and that region of the continent; and the custom of
carrying arms is still kept up among these continentals, from the old
piratical habits. The whole of Hellas used once to carry arms, their
habitations being unprotected and their communication with each other
unsafe; indeed, to wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with
them as with the barbarians. And the fact that the people in these
parts of Hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when
the same mode of life was once equally common to all. The Athenians
were the first to lay aside their weapons, and to adopt an easier and
more luxurious mode of life; indeed, it is only lately that their rich
old men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and
fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, a
fashion which spread to their Ionian kindred and long prevailed among
the old men there. On the contrary, a modest style of dressing, more in
conformity with modern ideas, was first adopted by the Lacedaemonians,
the rich doing their best to assimilate their way of life to that of
the common people. They also set the example of contending naked,
publicly stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic
exercises. Formerly, even in the Olympic contests, the athletes who
contended wore belts across their middles; and it is but a few years
since that the practice ceased. To this day among some of the
barbarians, especially in Asia, when prizes for boxing and wrestling
are offered, belts are worn by the combatants. And there are many other
points in which a likeness might be shown between the life of the
Hellenic world of old and the barbarian of to-day.

With respect to their towns, later on, at an era of increased
facilities of navigation and a greater supply of capital, we find the
shores becoming the site of walled towns, and the isthmuses being
occupied for the purposes of commerce and defence against a neighbour.
But the old towns, on account of the great prevalence of piracy, were
built away from the sea, whether on the islands or the continent, and
still remain in their old sites. For the pirates used to plunder one
another, and indeed all coast populations, whether seafaring or not.

The islanders, too, were great pirates. These islanders were Carians
and Phoenicians, by whom most of the islands were colonized, as was
proved by the following fact. During the purification of Delos by
Athens in this war all the graves in the island were taken up, and it
was found that above half their inmates were Carians: they were
identified by the fashion of the arms buried with them, and by the
method of interment, which was the same as the Carians still follow.
But as soon as Minos had formed his navy, communication by sea became
easier, as he colonized most of the islands, and thus expelled the
malefactors. The coast population now began to apply themselves more
closely to the acquisition of wealth, and their life became more
settled; some even began to build themselves walls on the strength of
their newly acquired riches. For the love of gain would reconcile the
weaker to the dominion of the stronger, and the possession of capital
enabled the more powerful to reduce the smaller towns to subjection.
And it was at a somewhat later stage of this development that they went
on the expedition against Troy.

What enabled Agamemnon to raise the armament was more, in my opinion,
his superiority in strength, than the oaths of Tyndareus, which bound
the suitors to follow him. Indeed, the account given by those
Peloponnesians who have been the recipients of the most credible
tradition is this. First of all Pelops, arriving among a needy
population from Asia with vast wealth, acquired such power that,
stranger though he was, the country was called after him; and this
power fortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his
descendants. Eurystheus had been killed in Attica by the Heraclids.
Atreus was his mother’s brother; and to the hands of his relation, who
had left his father on account of the death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus,
when he set out on his expedition, had committed Mycenæ and the
government. As time went on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus
complied with the wishes of the Mycenæans, who were influenced by fear
of the Heraclids—besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not
neglected to court the favour of the populace—and assumed the sceptre
of Mycenæ and the rest of the dominions of Eurystheus. And so the power
of the descendants of Pelops came to be greater than that of the
descendants of Perseus. To all this Agamemnon succeeded. He had also a
navy far stronger than his contemporaries, so that, in my opinion, fear
was quite as strong an element as love in the formation of the
confederate expedition. The strength of his navy is shown by the fact
that his own was the largest contingent, and that of the Arcadians was
furnished by him; this at least is what Homer says, if his testimony is
deemed sufficient. Besides, in his account of the transmission of the
sceptre, he calls him

Of many an isle, and of all Argos king.


Now Agamemnon’s was a continental power; and he could not have been
master of any except the adjacent islands (and these would not be
many), but through the possession of a fleet.

And from this expedition we may infer the character of earlier
enterprises. Now Mycenæ may have been a small place, and many of the
towns of that age may appear comparatively insignificant, but no exact
observer would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given
by the poets and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament. For I
suppose if Lacedaemon were to become desolate, and the temples and the
foundations of the public buildings were left, that as time went on
there would be a strong disposition with posterity to refuse to accept
her fame as a true exponent of her power. And yet they occupy
two-fifths of Peloponnese and lead the whole, not to speak of their
numerous allies without. Still, as the city is neither built in a
compact form nor adorned with magnificent temples and public edifices,
but composed of villages after the old fashion of Hellas, there would
be an impression of inadequacy. Whereas, if Athens were to suffer the
same misfortune, I suppose that any inference from the appearance
presented to the eye would make her power to have been twice as great
as it is. We have therefore no right to be sceptical, nor to content
ourselves with an inspection of a town to the exclusion of a
consideration of its power; but we may safely conclude that the
armament in question surpassed all before it, as it fell short of
modern efforts; if we can here also accept the testimony of Homer’s
poems, in which, without allowing for the exaggeration which a poet
would feel himself licensed to employ, we can see that it was far from
equalling ours. He has represented it as consisting of twelve hundred
vessels; the Boeotian complement of each ship being a hundred and
twenty men, that of the ships of Philoctetes fifty. By this, I
conceive, he meant to convey the maximum and the minimum complement: at
any rate, he does not specify the amount of any others in his catalogue
of the ships. That they were all rowers as well as warriors we see from
his account of the ships of Philoctetes, in which all the men at the
oar are bowmen. Now it is improbable that many supernumeraries sailed,
if we except the kings and high officers; especially as they had to
cross the open sea with munitions of war, in ships, moreover, that had
no decks, but were equipped in the old piratical fashion. So that if we
strike the average of the largest and smallest ships, the number of
those who sailed will appear inconsiderable, representing, as they did,
the whole force of Hellas. And this was due not so much to scarcity of
men as of money. Difficulty of subsistence made the invaders reduce the
numbers of the army to a point at which it might live on the country
during the prosecution of the war. Even after the victory they obtained
on their arrival—and a victory there must have been, or the
fortifications of the naval camp could never have been built—there is
no indication of their whole force having been employed; on the
contrary, they seem to have turned to cultivation of the Chersonese and
to piracy from want of supplies. This was what really enabled the
Trojans to keep the field for ten years against them; the dispersion of
the enemy making them always a match for the detachment left behind. If
they had brought plenty of supplies with them, and had persevered in
the war without scattering for piracy and agriculture, they would have
easily defeated the Trojans in the field, since they could hold their
own against them with the division on service. In short, if they had
stuck to the siege, the capture of Troy would have cost them less time
and less trouble. But as want of money proved the weakness of earlier
expeditions, so from the same cause even the one in question, more
famous than its predecessors, may be pronounced on the evidence of what
it effected to have been inferior to its renown and to the current
opinion about it formed under the tuition of the poets.

Even after the Trojan War, Hellas was still engaged in removing and
settling, and thus could not attain to the quiet which must precede
growth. The late return of the Hellenes from Ilium caused many
revolutions, and factions ensued almost everywhere; and it was the
citizens thus driven into exile who founded the cities. Sixty years
after the capture of Ilium, the modern Boeotians were driven out of
Arne by the Thessalians, and settled in the present Boeotia, the former
Cadmeis; though there was a division of them there before, some of whom
joined the expedition to Ilium. Twenty years later, the Dorians and the
Heraclids became masters of Peloponnese; so that much had to be done
and many years had to elapse before Hellas could attain to a durable
tranquillity undisturbed by removals, and could begin to send out
colonies, as Athens did to Ionia and most of the islands, and the
Peloponnesians to most of Italy and Sicily and some places in the rest
of Hellas. All these places were founded subsequently to the war with
Troy.

But as the power of Hellas grew, and the acquisition of wealth became
more an object, the revenues of the states increasing, tyrannies were
by their means established almost everywhere—the old form of government
being hereditary monarchy with definite prerogatives—and Hellas began
to fit out fleets and apply herself more closely to the sea. It is said
that the Corinthians were the first to approach the modern style of
naval architecture, and that Corinth was the first place in Hellas
where galleys were built; and we have Ameinocles, a Corinthian
shipwright, making four ships for the Samians. Dating from the end of
this war, it is nearly three hundred years ago that Ameinocles went to
Samos. Again, the earliest sea-fight in history was between the
Corinthians and Corcyraeans; this was about two hundred and sixty years
ago, dating from the same time. Planted on an isthmus, Corinth had from
time out of mind been a commercial emporium; as formerly almost all
communication between the Hellenes within and without Peloponnese was
carried on overland, and the Corinthian territory was the highway
through which it travelled. She had consequently great money resources,
as is shown by the epithet “wealthy” bestowed by the old poets on the
place, and this enabled her, when traffic by sea became more common, to
procure her navy and put down piracy; and as she could offer a mart for
both branches of the trade, she acquired for herself all the power
which a large revenue affords. Subsequently the Ionians attained to
great naval strength in the reign of Cyrus, the first king of the
Persians, and of his son Cambyses, and while they were at war with the
former commanded for a while the Ionian sea. Polycrates also, the
tyrant of Samos, had a powerful navy in the reign of Cambyses, with
which he reduced many of the islands, and among them Rhenea, which he
consecrated to the Delian Apollo. About this time also the Phocaeans,
while they were founding Marseilles, defeated the Carthaginians in a
sea-fight. These were the most powerful navies. And even these,
although so many generations had elapsed since the Trojan war, seem to
have been principally composed of the old fifty-oars and long-boats,
and to have counted few galleys among their ranks. Indeed it was only
shortly the Persian war, and the death of Darius the successor of
Cambyses, that the Sicilian tyrants and the Corcyraeans acquired any
large number of galleys. For after these there were no navies of any
account in Hellas till the expedition of Xerxes; Aegina, Athens, and
others may have possessed a few vessels, but they were principally
fifty-oars. It was quite at the end of this period that the war with
Aegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled Themistocles
to persuade the Athenians to build the fleet with which they fought at
Salamis; and even these vessels had not complete decks.

The navies, then, of the Hellenes during the period we have traversed
were what I have described. All their insignificance did not prevent
their being an element of the greatest power to those who cultivated
them, alike in revenue and in dominion. They were the means by which
the islands were reached and reduced, those of the smallest area
falling the easiest prey. Wars by land there were none, none at least
by which power was acquired; we have the usual border contests, but of
distant expeditions with conquest for object we hear nothing among the
Hellenes. There was no union of subject cities round a great state, no
spontaneous combination of equals for confederate expeditions; what
fighting there was consisted merely of local warfare between rival
neighbours. The nearest approach to a coalition took place in the old
war between Chalcis and Eretria; this was a quarrel in which the rest
of the Hellenic name did to some extent take sides.

Various, too, were the obstacles which the national growth encountered
in various localities. The power of the Ionians was advancing with
rapid strides, when it came into collision with Persia, under King
Cyrus, who, after having dethroned Croesus and overrun everything
between the Halys and the sea, stopped not till he had reduced the
cities of the coast; the islands being only left to be subdued by
Darius and the Phoenician navy.

Again, wherever there were tyrants, their habit of providing simply for
themselves, of looking solely to their personal comfort and family
aggrandizement, made safety the great aim of their policy, and
prevented anything great proceeding from them; though they would each
have their affairs with their immediate neighbours. All this is only
true of the mother country, for in Sicily they attained to very great
power. Thus for a long time everywhere in Hellas do we find causes
which make the states alike incapable of combination for great and
national ends, or of any vigorous action of their own.

But at last a time came when the tyrants of Athens and the far older
tyrannies of the rest of Hellas were, with the exception of those in
Sicily, once and for all put down by Lacedaemon; for this city, though
after the settlement of the Dorians, its present inhabitants, it
suffered from factions for an unparalleled length of time, still at a
very early period obtained good laws, and enjoyed a freedom from
tyrants which was unbroken; it has possessed the same form of
government for more than four hundred years, reckoning to the end of
the late war, and has thus been in a position to arrange the affairs of
the other states. Not many years after the deposition of the tyrants,
the battle of Marathon was fought between the Medes and the Athenians.
Ten years afterwards, the barbarian returned with the armada for the
subjugation of Hellas. In the face of this great danger, the command of
the confederate Hellenes was assumed by the Lacedaemonians in virtue of
their superior power; and the Athenians, having made up their minds to
abandon their city, broke up their homes, threw themselves into their
ships, and became a naval people. This coalition, after repulsing the
barbarian, soon afterwards split into two sections, which included the
Hellenes who had revolted from the King, as well as those who had aided
him in the war. At the end of the one stood Athens, at the head of the
other Lacedaemon, one the first naval, the other the first military
power in Hellas. For a short time the league held together, till the
Lacedaemonians and Athenians quarrelled and made war upon each other
with their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later
were drawn, though some might at first remain neutral. So that the
whole period from the Median war to this, with some peaceful intervals,
was spent by each power in war, either with its rival, or with its own
revolted allies, and consequently afforded them constant practice in
military matters, and that experience which is learnt in the school of
danger.

The policy of Lacedaemon was not to exact tribute from her allies, but
merely to secure their subservience to her interests by establishing
oligarchies among them; Athens, on the contrary, had by degrees
deprived hers of their ships, and imposed instead contributions in
money on all except Chios and Lesbos. Both found their resources for
this war separately to exceed the sum of their strength when the
alliance flourished intact.

Having now given the result of my inquiries into early times, I grant
that there will be a difficulty in believing every particular detail.
The way that most men deal with traditions, even traditions of their
own country, is to receive them all alike as they are delivered,
without applying any critical test whatever. The general Athenian
public fancy that Hipparchus was tyrant when he fell by the hands of
Harmodius and Aristogiton, not knowing that Hippias, the eldest of the
sons of Pisistratus, was really supreme, and that Hipparchus and
Thessalus were his brothers; and that Harmodius and Aristogiton
suspecting, on the very day, nay at the very moment fixed on for the
deed, that information had been conveyed to Hippias by their
accomplices, concluded that he had been warned, and did not attack him,
yet, not liking to be apprehended and risk their lives for nothing,
fell upon Hipparchus near the temple of the daughters of Leos, and slew
him as he was arranging the Panathenaic procession.

There are many other unfounded ideas current among the rest of the
Hellenes, even on matters of contemporary history, which have not been
obscured by time. For instance, there is the notion that the
Lacedaemonian kings have two votes each, the fact being that they have
only one; and that there is a company of Pitane, there being simply no
such thing. So little pains do the vulgar take in the investigation of
truth, accepting readily the first story that comes to hand. On the
whole, however, the conclusions I have drawn from the proofs quoted
may, I believe, safely be relied on. Assuredly they will not be
disturbed either by the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of
his craft, or by the compositions of the chroniclers that are
attractive at truth’s expense; the subjects they treat of being out of
the reach of evidence, and time having robbed most of them of
historical value by enthroning them in the region of legend. Turning
from these, we can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the
clearest data, and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be
expected in matters of such antiquity. To come to this war: despite the
known disposition of the actors in a struggle to overrate its
importance, and when it is over to return to their admiration of
earlier events, yet an examination of the facts will show that it was
much greater than the wars which preceded it.

With reference to the speeches in this history, some were delivered
before the war began, others while it was going on; some I heard
myself, others I got from various quarters; it was in all cases
difficult to carry them word for word in one’s memory, so my habit has
been to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them
by the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to
the general sense of what they really said. And with reference to the
narrative of events, far from permitting myself to derive it from the
first source that came to hand, I did not even trust my own
impressions, but it rests partly on what I saw myself, partly on what
others saw for me, the accuracy of the report being always tried by the
most severe and detailed tests possible. My conclusions have cost me
some labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same
occurrences by different eye-witnesses, arising sometimes from
imperfect memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the
other. The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract
somewhat from its interest; but if it be judged useful by those
inquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the
interpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must
resemble if it does not reflect it, I shall be content. In fine, I have
written my work, not as an essay which is to win the applause of the
moment, but as a possession for all time.

The Median War, the greatest achievement of past times, yet found a
speedy decision in two actions by sea and two by land. The
Peloponnesian War was prolonged to an immense length, and, long as it
was, it was short without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought
upon Hellas. Never had so many cities been taken and laid desolate,
here by the barbarians, here by the parties contending (the old
inhabitants being sometimes removed to make room for others); never was
there so much banishing and blood-shedding, now on the field of battle,
now in the strife of faction. Old stories of occurrences handed down by
tradition, but scantily confirmed by experience, suddenly ceased to be
incredible; there were earthquakes of unparalleled extent and violence;
eclipses of the sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded in previous
history; there were great droughts in sundry places and consequent
famines, and that most calamitous and awfully fatal visitation, the
plague. All this came upon them with the late war, which was begun by
the Athenians and Peloponnesians by the dissolution of the thirty
years’ truce made after the conquest of Euboea. To the question why
they broke the treaty, I answer by placing first an account of their
grounds of complaint and points of difference, that no one may ever
have to ask the immediate cause which plunged the Hellenes into a war
of such magnitude. The real cause I consider to be the one which was
formally most kept out of sight. The growth of the power of Athens, and
the alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable. Still
it is well to give the grounds alleged by either side which led to the
dissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of the war.




CHAPTER II


Causes of the War—The Affair of Epidamnus—The Affair of Potidæa


The city of Epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the Ionic
Gulf. Its vicinity is inhabited by the Taulantians, an Illyrian people.
The place is a colony from Corcyra, founded by Phalius, son of
Eratocleides, of the family of the Heraclids, who had according to
ancient usage been summoned for the purpose from Corinth, the mother
country. The colonists were joined by some Corinthians, and others of
the Dorian race. Now, as time went on, the city of Epidamnus became
great and populous; but falling a prey to factions arising, it is said,
from a war with her neighbours the barbarians, she became much
enfeebled, and lost a considerable amount of her power. The last act
before the war was the expulsion of the nobles by the people. The
exiled party joined the barbarians, and proceeded to plunder those in
the city by sea and land; and the Epidamnians, finding themselves hard
pressed, sent ambassadors to Corcyra beseeching their mother country
not to allow them to perish, but to make up matters between them and
the exiles, and to rid them of the war with the barbarians. The
ambassadors seated themselves in the temple of Hera as suppliants, and
made the above requests to the Corcyraeans. But the Corcyraeans refused
to accept their supplication, and they were dismissed without having
effected anything.

When the Epidamnians found that no help could be expected from Corcyra,
they were in a strait what to do next. So they sent to Delphi and
inquired of the God whether they should deliver their city to the
Corinthians and endeavour to obtain some assistance from their
founders. The answer he gave them was to deliver the city and place
themselves under Corinthian protection. So the Epidamnians went to
Corinth and delivered over the colony in obedience to the commands of
the oracle. They showed that their founder came from Corinth, and
revealed the answer of the god; and they begged them not to allow them
to perish, but to assist them. This the Corinthians consented to do.
Believing the colony to belong as much to themselves as to the
Corcyraeans, they felt it to be a kind of duty to undertake their
protection. Besides, they hated the Corcyraeans for their contempt of
the mother country. Instead of meeting with the usual honours accorded
to the parent city by every other colony at public assemblies, such as
precedence at sacrifices, Corinth found herself treated with contempt
by a power which in point of wealth could stand comparison with any
even of the richest communities in Hellas, which possessed great
military strength, and which sometimes could not repress a pride in the
high naval position of an island whose nautical renown dated from the
days of its old inhabitants, the Phaeacians. This was one reason of the
care that they lavished on their fleet, which became very efficient;
indeed they began the war with a force of a hundred and twenty galleys.

All these grievances made Corinth eager to send the promised aid to
Epidamnus. Advertisement was made for volunteer settlers, and a force
of Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Corinthians was dispatched. They marched
by land to Apollonia, a Corinthian colony, the route by sea being
avoided from fear of Corcyraean interruption. When the Corcyraeans
heard of the arrival of the settlers and troops in Epidamnus, and the
surrender of the colony to Corinth, they took fire. Instantly putting
to sea with five-and-twenty ships, which were quickly followed by
others, they insolently commanded the Epidamnians to receive back the
banished nobles—(it must be premised that the Epidamnian exiles had
come to Corcyra and, pointing to the sepulchres of their ancestors, had
appealed to their kindred to restore them)—and to dismiss the
Corinthian garrison and settlers. But to all this the Epidamnians
turned a deaf ear. Upon this the Corcyraeans commenced operations
against them with a fleet of forty sail. They took with them the
exiles, with a view to their restoration, and also secured the services
of the Illyrians. Sitting down before the city, they issued a
proclamation to the effect that any of the natives that chose, and the
foreigners, might depart unharmed, with the alternative of being
treated as enemies. On their refusal the Corcyraeans proceeded to
besiege the city, which stands on an isthmus; and the Corinthians,
receiving intelligence of the investment of Epidamnus, got together an
armament and proclaimed a colony to Epidamnus, perfect political
equality being guaranteed to all who chose to go. Any who were not
prepared to sail at once might, by paying down the sum of fifty
Corinthian drachmae, have a share in the colony without leaving
Corinth. Great numbers took advantage of this proclamation, some being
ready to start directly, others paying the requisite forfeit. In case
of their passage being disputed by the Corcyraeans, several cities were
asked to lend them a convoy. Megara prepared to accompany them with
eight ships, Pale in Cephallonia with four; Epidaurus furnished five,
Hermione one, Troezen two, Leucas ten, and Ambracia eight. The Thebans
and Phliasians were asked for money, the Eleans for hulls as well;
while Corinth herself furnished thirty ships and three thousand heavy
infantry.

When the Corcyraeans heard of their preparations they came to Corinth
with envoys from Lacedaemon and Sicyon, whom they persuaded to
accompany them, and bade her recall the garrison and settlers, as she
had nothing to do with Epidamnus. If, however, she had any claims to
make, they were willing to submit the matter to the arbitration of such
of the cities in Peloponnese as should be chosen by mutual agreement,
and that the colony should remain with the city to whom the arbitrators
might assign it. They were also willing to refer the matter to the
oracle at Delphi. If, in defiance of their protestations, war was
appealed to, they should be themselves compelled by this violence to
seek friends in quarters where they had no desire to seek them, and to
make even old ties give way to the necessity of assistance. The answer
they got from Corinth was that, if they would withdraw their fleet and
the barbarians from Epidamnus, negotiation might be possible; but,
while the town was still being besieged, going before arbitrators was
out of the question. The Corcyraeans retorted that if Corinth would
withdraw her troops from Epidamnus they would withdraw theirs, or they
were ready to let both parties remain in statu quo, an armistice being
concluded till judgment could be given.

Turning a deaf ear to all these proposals, when their ships were manned
and their allies had come in, the Corinthians sent a herald before them
to declare war and, getting under way with seventy-five ships and two
thousand heavy infantry, sailed for Epidamnus to give battle to the
Corcyraeans. The fleet was under the command of Aristeus, son of
Pellichas, Callicrates, son of Callias, and Timanor, son of Timanthes;
the troops under that of Archetimus, son of Eurytimus, and Isarchidas,
son of Isarchus. When they had reached Actium in the territory of
Anactorium, at the mouth of the mouth of the Gulf of Ambracia, where
the temple of Apollo stands, the Corcyraeans sent on a herald in a
light boat to warn them not to sail against them. Meanwhile they
proceeded to man their ships, all of which had been equipped for
action, the old vessels being undergirded to make them seaworthy. On
the return of the herald without any peaceful answer from the
Corinthians, their ships being now manned, they put out to sea to meet
the enemy with a fleet of eighty sail (forty were engaged in the siege
of Epidamnus), formed line, and went into action, and gained a decisive
victory, and destroyed fifteen of the Corinthian vessels. The same day
had seen Epidamnus compelled by its besiegers to capitulate; the
conditions being that the foreigners should be sold, and the
Corinthians kept as prisoners of war, till their fate should be
otherwise decided.

After the engagement the Corcyraeans set up a trophy on Leukimme, a
headland of Corcyra, and slew all their captives except the
Corinthians, whom they kept as prisoners of war. Defeated at sea, the
Corinthians and their allies repaired home, and left the Corcyraeans
masters of all the sea about those parts. Sailing to Leucas, a
Corinthian colony, they ravaged their territory, and burnt Cyllene, the
harbour of the Eleans, because they had furnished ships and money to
Corinth. For almost the whole of the period that followed the battle
they remained masters of the sea, and the allies of Corinth were
harassed by Corcyraean cruisers. At last Corinth, roused by the
sufferings of her allies, sent out ships and troops in the fall of the
summer, who formed an encampment at Actium and about Chimerium, in
Thesprotis, for the protection of Leucas and the rest of the friendly
cities. The Corcyraeans on their part formed a similar station on
Leukimme. Neither party made any movement, but they remained
confronting each other till the end of the summer, and winter was at
hand before either of them returned home.

Corinth, exasperated by the war with the Corcyraeans, spent the whole
of the year after the engagement and that succeeding it in building
ships, and in straining every nerve to form an efficient fleet; rowers
being drawn from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas by the inducement
of large bounties. The Corcyraeans, alarmed at the news of their
preparations, being without a single ally in Hellas (for they had not
enrolled themselves either in the Athenian or in the Lacedaemonian
confederacy), decided to repair to Athens in order to enter into
alliance and to endeavour to procure support from her. Corinth also,
hearing of their intentions, sent an embassy to Athens to prevent the
Corcyraean navy being joined by the Athenian, and her prospect of
ordering the war according to her wishes being thus impeded. An
assembly was convoked, and the rival advocates appeared: the
Corcyraeans spoke as follows:

“Athenians! when a people that have not rendered any important service
or support to their neighbours in times past, for which they might
claim to be repaid, appear before them as we now appear before you to
solicit their assistance, they may fairly be required to satisfy
certain preliminary conditions. They should show, first, that it is
expedient or at least safe to grant their request; next, that they will
retain a lasting sense of the kindness. But if they cannot clearly
establish any of these points, they must not be annoyed if they meet
with a rebuff. Now the Corcyraeans believe that with their petition for
assistance they can also give you a satisfactory answer on these
points, and they have therefore dispatched us hither. It has so
happened that our policy as regards you with respect to this request,
turns out to be inconsistent, and as regards our interests, to be at
the present crisis inexpedient. We say inconsistent, because a power
which has never in the whole of her past history been willing to ally
herself with any of her neighbours, is now found asking them to ally
themselves with her. And we say inexpedient, because in our present war
with Corinth it has left us in a position of entire isolation, and what
once seemed the wise precaution of refusing to involve ourselves in
alliances with other powers, lest we should also involve ourselves in
risks of their choosing, has now proved to be folly and weakness. It is
true that in the late naval engagement we drove back the Corinthians
from our shores single-handed. But they have now got together a still
larger armament from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas; and we, seeing
our utter inability to cope with them without foreign aid, and the
magnitude of the danger which subjection to them implies, find it
necessary to ask help from you and from every other power. And we hope
to be excused if we forswear our old principle of complete political
isolation, a principle which was not adopted with any sinister
intention, but was rather the consequence of an error in judgment.

“Now there are many reasons why in the event of your compliance you
will congratulate yourselves on this request having been made to you.
First, because your assistance will be rendered to a power which,
herself inoffensive, is a victim to the injustice of others. Secondly,
because all that we most value is at stake in the present contest, and
your welcome of us under these circumstances will be a proof of
goodwill which will ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in
our hearts. Thirdly, yourselves excepted, we are the greatest naval
power in Hellas. Moreover, can you conceive a stroke of good fortune
more rare in itself, or more disheartening to your enemies, than that
the power whose adhesion you would have valued above much material and
moral strength should present herself self-invited, should deliver
herself into your hands without danger and without expense, and should
lastly put you in the way of gaining a high character in the eyes of
the world, the gratitude of those whom you shall assist, and a great
accession of strength for yourselves? You may search all history
without finding many instances of a people gaining all these advantages
at once, or many instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance
being in a position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits
as much safety and honour as she will receive. But it will be urged
that it is only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful. To
this we answer that if any of you imagine that that war is far off, he
is grievously mistaken, and is blind to the fact that Lacedaemon
regards you with jealousy and desires war, and that Corinth is powerful
there—the same, remember, that is your enemy, and is even now trying to
subdue us as a preliminary to attacking you. And this she does to
prevent our becoming united by a common enmity, and her having us both
on her hands, and also to ensure getting the start of you in one of two
ways, either by crippling our power or by making its strength her own.
Now it is our policy to be beforehand with her—that is, for Corcyra to
make an offer of alliance and for you to accept it; in fact, we ought
to form plans against her instead of waiting to defeat the plans she
forms against us.

“If she asserts that for you to receive a colony of hers into alliance
is not right, let her know that every colony that is well treated
honours its parent state, but becomes estranged from it by injustice.
For colonists are not sent forth on the understanding that they are to
be the slaves of those that remain behind, but that they are to be
their equals. And that Corinth was injuring us is clear. Invited to
refer the dispute about Epidamnus to arbitration, they chose to
prosecute their complaints war rather than by a fair trial. And let
their conduct towards us who are their kindred be a warning to you not
to be misled by their deceit, nor to yield to their direct requests;
concessions to adversaries only end in self-reproach, and the more
strictly they are avoided the greater will be the chance of security.

“If it be urged that your reception of us will be a breach of the
treaty existing between you and Lacedaemon, the answer is that we are a
neutral state, and that one of the express provisions of that treaty is
that it shall be competent for any Hellenic state that is neutral to
join whichever side it pleases. And it is intolerable for Corinth to be
allowed to obtain men for her navy not only from her allies, but also
from the rest of Hellas, no small number being furnished by your own
subjects; while we are to be excluded both from the alliance left open
to us by treaty, and from any assistance that we might get from other
quarters, and you are to be accused of political immorality if you
comply with our request. On the other hand, we shall have much greater
cause to complain of you, if you do not comply with it; if we, who are
in peril and are no enemies of yours, meet with a repulse at your
hands, while Corinth, who is the aggressor and your enemy, not only
meets with no hindrance from you, but is even allowed to draw material
for war from your dependencies. This ought not to be, but you should
either forbid her enlisting men in your dominions, or you should lend
us too what help you may think advisable.

“But your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support.
The advantages of this course, as we premised in the beginning of our
speech, are many. We mention one that is perhaps the chief. Could there
be a clearer guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact
that the power which is at enmity with you is also at enmity with us,
and that that power is fully able to punish defection? And there is a
wide difference between declining the alliance of an inland and of a
maritime power. For your first endeavour should be to prevent, if
possible, the existence of any naval power except your own; failing
this, to secure the friendship of the strongest that does exist. And if
any of you believe that what we urge is expedient, but fear to act upon
this belief, lest it should lead to a breach of the treaty, you must
remember that on the one hand, whatever your fears, your strength will
be formidable to your antagonists; on the other, whatever the
confidence you derive from refusing to receive us, your weakness will
have no terrors for a strong enemy. You must also remember that your
decision is for Athens no less than Corcyra, and that you are not
making the best provision for her interests, if at a time when you are
anxiously scanning the horizon that you may be in readiness for the
breaking out of the war which is all but upon you, you hesitate to
attach to your side a place whose adhesion or estrangement is alike
pregnant with the most vital consequences. For it lies conveniently for
the coast-navigation in the direction of Italy and Sicily, being able
to bar the passage of naval reinforcements from thence to Peloponnese,
and from Peloponnese thither; and it is in other respects a most
desirable station. To sum up as shortly as possible, embracing both
general and particular considerations, let this show you the folly of
sacrificing us. Remember that there are but three considerable naval
powers in Hellas—Athens, Corcyra, and Corinth—and that if you allow two
of these three to become one, and Corinth to secure us for herself, you
will have to hold the sea against the united fleets of Corcyra and
Peloponnese. But if you receive us, you will have our ships to
reinforce you in the struggle.”

Such were the words of the Corcyraeans. After they had finished, the
Corinthians spoke as follows:

“These Corcyraeans in the speech we have just heard do not confine
themselves to the question of their reception into your alliance. They
also talk of our being guilty of injustice, and their being the victims
of an unjustifiable war. It becomes necessary for us to touch upon both
these points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say, that
you may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim, and have
good cause to reject their petition. According to them, their old
policy of refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation.
It was in fact adopted for bad ends, not for good; indeed their conduct
is such as to make them by no means desirous of having allies present
to witness it, or of having the shame of asking their concurrence.
Besides, their geographical situation makes them independent of others,
and consequently the decision in cases where they injure any lies not
with judges appointed by mutual agreement, but with themselves,
because, while they seldom make voyages to their neighbours, they are
constantly being visited by foreign vessels which are compelled to put
in to Corcyra. In short, the object that they propose to themselves, in
their specious policy of complete isolation, is not to avoid sharing in
the crimes of others, but to secure monopoly of crime to themselves—the
licence of outrage wherever they can compel, of fraud wherever they can
elude, and the enjoyment of their gains without shame. And yet if they
were the honest men they pretend to be, the less hold that others had
upon them, the stronger would be the light in which they might have put
their honesty by giving and taking what was just.

“But such has not been their conduct either towards others or towards
us. The attitude of our colony towards us has always been one of
estrangement and is now one of hostility; for, say they: ‘We were not
sent out to be ill-treated.’ We rejoin that we did not found the colony
to be insulted by them, but to be their head and to be regarded with a
proper respect. At any rate our other colonies honour us, and we are
much beloved by our colonists; and clearly, if the majority are
satisfied with us, these can have no good reason for a dissatisfaction
in which they stand alone, and we are not acting improperly in making
war against them, nor are we making war against them without having
received signal provocation. Besides, if we were in the wrong, it would
be honourable in them to give way to our wishes, and disgraceful for us
to trample on their moderation; but in the pride and licence of wealth
they have sinned again and again against us, and never more deeply than
when Epidamnus, our dependency, which they took no steps to claim in
its distress upon our coming to relieve it, was by them seized, and is
now held by force of arms.

“As to their allegation that they wished the question to be first
submitted to arbitration, it is obvious that a challenge coming from
the party who is safe in a commanding position cannot gain the credit
due only to him who, before appealing to arms, in deeds as well as
words, places himself on a level with his adversary. In their case, it
was not before they laid siege to the place, but after they at length
understood that we should not tamely suffer it, that they thought of
the specious word arbitration. And not satisfied with their own
misconduct there, they appear here now requiring you to join with them
not in alliance but in crime, and to receive them in spite of their
being at enmity with us. But it was when they stood firmest that they
should have made overtures to you, and not at a time when we have been
wronged and they are in peril; nor yet at a time when you will be
admitting to a share in your protection those who never admitted you to
a share in their power, and will be incurring an equal amount of blame
from us with those in whose offences you had no hand. No, they should
have shared their power with you before they asked you to share your
fortunes with them.

“So then the reality of the grievances we come to complain of, and the
violence and rapacity of our opponents, have both been proved. But that
you cannot equitably receive them, this you have still to learn. It may
be true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall be
competent for any state, whose name was not down on the list, to join
whichever side it pleases. But this agreement is not meant for those
whose object in joining is the injury of other powers, but for those
whose need of support does not arise from the fact of defection, and
whose adhesion will not bring to the power that is mad enough to
receive them war instead of peace; which will be the case with you, if
you refuse to listen to us. For you cannot become their auxiliary and
remain our friend; if you join in their attack, you must share the
punishment which the defenders inflict on them. And yet you have the
best possible right to be neutral, or, failing this, you should on the
contrary join us against them. Corinth is at least in treaty with you;
with Corcyra you were never even in truce. But do not lay down the
principle that defection is to be patronized. Did we on the defection
of the Samians record our vote against you, when the rest of the
Peloponnesian powers were equally divided on the question whether they
should assist them? No, we told them to their face that every power has
a right to punish its own allies. Why, if you make it your policy to
receive and assist all offenders, you will find that just as many of
your dependencies will come over to us, and the principle that you
establish will press less heavily on us than on yourselves.

“This then is what Hellenic law entitles us to demand as a right. But
we have also advice to offer and claims on your gratitude, which, since
there is no danger of our injuring you, as we are not enemies, and
since our friendship does not amount to very frequent intercourse, we
say ought to be liquidated at the present juncture. When you were in
want of ships of war for the war against the Aeginetans, before the
Persian invasion, Corinth supplied you with twenty vessels. That good
turn, and the line we took on the Samian question, when we were the
cause of the Peloponnesians refusing to assist them, enabled you to
conquer Aegina and to punish Samos. And we acted thus at crises when,
if ever, men are wont in their efforts against their enemies to forget
everything for the sake of victory, regarding him who assists them then
as a friend, even if thus far he has been a foe, and him who opposes
them then as a foe, even if he has thus far been a friend; indeed they
allow their real interests to suffer from their absorbing preoccupation
in the struggle.

“Weigh well these considerations, and let your youth learn what they
are from their elders, and let them determine to do unto us as we have
done unto you. And let them not acknowledge the justice of what we say,
but dispute its wisdom in the contingency of war. Not only is the
straightest path generally speaking the wisest; but the coming of the
war, which the Corcyraeans have used as a bugbear to persuade you to do
wrong, is still uncertain, and it is not worth while to be carried away
by it into gaining the instant and declared enmity of Corinth. It were,
rather, wise to try and counteract the unfavourable impression which
your conduct to Megara has created. For kindness opportunely shown has
a greater power of removing old grievances than the facts of the case
may warrant. And do not be seduced by the prospect of a great naval
alliance. Abstinence from all injustice to other first-rate powers is a
greater tower of strength than anything that can be gained by the
sacrifice of permanent tranquillity for an apparent temporary
advantage. It is now our turn to benefit by the principle that we laid
down at Lacedaemon, that every power has a right to punish her own
allies. We now claim to receive the same from you, and protest against
your rewarding us for benefiting you by our vote by injuring us by
yours. On the contrary, return us like for like, remembering that this
is that very crisis in which he who lends aid is most a friend, and he
who opposes is most a foe. And for these Corcyraeans—neither receive
them into alliance in our despite, nor be their abettors in crime. So
do, and you will act as we have a right to expect of you, and at the
same time best consult your own interests.”

Such were the words of the Corinthians.

When the Athenians had heard both out, two assemblies were held. In the
first there was a manifest disposition to listen to the representations
of Corinth; in the second, public feeling had changed and an alliance
with Corcyra was decided on, with certain reservations. It was to be a
defensive, not an offensive alliance. It did not involve a breach of
the treaty with Peloponnese: Athens could not be required to join
Corcyra in any attack upon Corinth. But each of the contracting parties
had a right to the other’s assistance against invasion, whether of his
own territory or that of an ally. For it began now to be felt that the
coming of the Peloponnesian war was only a question of time, and no one
was willing to see a naval power of such magnitude as Corcyra
sacrificed to Corinth; though if they could let them weaken each other
by mutual conflict, it would be no bad preparation for the struggle
which Athens might one day have to wage with Corinth and the other
naval powers. At the same time the island seemed to lie conveniently on
the coasting passage to Italy and Sicily. With these views, Athens
received Corcyra into alliance and, on the departure of the Corinthians
not long afterwards, sent ten ships to their assistance. They were
commanded by Lacedaemonius, the son of Cimon, Diotimus, the son of
Strombichus, and Proteas, the son of Epicles. Their instructions were
to avoid collision with the Corinthian fleet except under certain
circumstances. If it sailed to Corcyra and threatened a landing on her
coast, or in any of her possessions, they were to do their utmost to
prevent it. These instructions were prompted by an anxiety to avoid a
breach of the treaty.

Meanwhile the Corinthians completed their preparations, and sailed for
Corcyra with a hundred and fifty ships. Of these Elis furnished ten,
Megara twelve, Leucas ten, Ambracia twenty-seven, Anactorium one, and
Corinth herself ninety. Each of these contingents had its own admiral,
the Corinthian being under the command of Xenoclides, son of Euthycles,
with four colleagues. Sailing from Leucas, they made land at the part
of the continent opposite Corcyra. They anchored in the harbour of
Chimerium, in the territory of Thesprotis, above which, at some
distance from the sea, lies the city of Ephyre, in the Elean district.
By this city the Acherusian lake pours its waters into the sea. It gets
its name from the river Acheron, which flows through Thesprotis and
falls into the lake. There also the river Thyamis flows, forming the
boundary between Thesprotis and Kestrine; and between these rivers
rises the point of Chimerium. In this part of the continent the
Corinthians now came to anchor, and formed an encampment. When the
Corcyraeans saw them coming, they manned a hundred and ten ships,
commanded by Meikiades, Aisimides, and Eurybatus, and stationed
themselves at one of the Sybota isles; the ten Athenian ships being
present. On Point Leukimme they posted their land forces, and a
thousand heavy infantry who had come from Zacynthus to their
assistance. Nor were the Corinthians on the mainland without their
allies. The barbarians flocked in large numbers to their assistance,
the inhabitants of this part of the continent being old allies of
theirs.

When the Corinthian preparations were completed, they took three days’
provisions and put out from Chimerium by night, ready for action.
Sailing with the dawn, they sighted the Corcyraean fleet out at sea and
coming towards them. When they perceived each other, both sides formed
in order of battle. On the Corcyraean right wing lay the Athenian
ships, the rest of the line being occupied by their own vessels formed
in three squadrons, each of which was commanded by one of the three
admirals. Such was the Corcyraean formation. The Corinthian was as
follows: on the right wing lay the Megarian and Ambraciot ships, in the
centre the rest of the allies in order. But the left was composed of
the best sailers in the Corinthian navy, to encounter the Athenians and
the right wing of the Corcyraeans. As soon as the signals were raised
on either side, they joined battle. Both sides had a large number of
heavy infantry on their decks, and a large number of archers and
darters, the old imperfect armament still prevailing. The sea-fight was
an obstinate one, though not remarkable for its science; indeed it was
more like a battle by land. Whenever they charged each other, the
multitude and crush of the vessels made it by no means easy to get
loose; besides, their hopes of victory lay principally in the heavy
infantry on the decks, who stood and fought in order, the ships
remaining stationary. The manoeuvre of breaking the line was not tried;
in short, strength and pluck had more share in the fight than science.
Everywhere tumult reigned, the battle being one scene of confusion;
meanwhile the Athenian ships, by coming up to the Corcyraeans whenever
they were pressed, served to alarm the enemy, though their commanders
could not join in the battle from fear of their instructions. The right
wing of the Corinthians suffered most. The Corcyraeans routed it, and
chased them in disorder to the continent with twenty ships, sailed up
to their camp, and burnt the tents which they found empty, and
plundered the stuff. So in this quarter the Corinthians and their
allies were defeated, and the Corcyraeans were victorious. But where
the Corinthians themselves were, on the left, they gained a decided
success; the scanty forces of the Corcyraeans being further weakened by
the want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit. Seeing the
Corcyraeans hard pressed, the Athenians began at length to assist them
more unequivocally. At first, it is true, they refrained from charging
any ships; but when the rout was becoming patent, and the Corinthians
were pressing on, the time at last came when every one set to, and all
distinction was laid aside, and it came to this point, that the
Corinthians and Athenians raised their hands against each other.

After the rout, the Corinthians, instead of employing themselves in
lashing fast and hauling after them the hulls of the vessels which they
had disabled, turned their attention to the men, whom they butchered as
they sailed through, not caring so much to make prisoners. Some even of
their own friends were slain by them, by mistake, in their ignorance of
the defeat of the right wing For the number of the ships on both sides,
and the distance to which they covered the sea, made it difficult,
after they had once joined, to distinguish between the conquering and
the conquered; this battle proving far greater than any before it, any
at least between Hellenes, for the number of vessels engaged. After the
Corinthians had chased the Corcyraeans to the land, they turned to the
wrecks and their dead, most of whom they succeeded in getting hold of
and conveying to Sybota, the rendezvous of the land forces furnished by
their barbarian allies. Sybota, it must be known, is a desert harbour
of Thesprotis. This task over, they mustered anew, and sailed against
the Corcyraeans, who on their part advanced to meet them with all their
ships that were fit for service and remaining to them, accompanied by
the Athenian vessels, fearing that they might attempt a landing in
their territory. It was by this time getting late, and the paean had
been sung for the attack, when the Corinthians suddenly began to back
water. They had observed twenty Athenian ships sailing up, which had
been sent out afterwards to reinforce the ten vessels by the Athenians,
who feared, as it turned out justly, the defeat of the Corcyraeans and
the inability of their handful of ships to protect them. These ships
were thus seen by the Corinthians first. They suspected that they were
from Athens, and that those which they saw were not all, but that there
were more behind; they accordingly began to retire. The Corcyraeans
meanwhile had not sighted them, as they were advancing from a point
which they could not so well see, and were wondering why the
Corinthians were backing water, when some caught sight of them, and
cried out that there were ships in sight ahead. Upon this they also
retired; for it was now getting dark, and the retreat of the
Corinthians had suspended hostilities. Thus they parted from each
other, and the battle ceased with night. The Corcyraeans were in their
camp at Leukimme, when these twenty ships from Athens, under the
command of Glaucon, the son of Leagrus, and Andocides, son of Leogoras,
bore on through the corpses and the wrecks, and sailed up to the camp,
not long after they were sighted. It was now night, and the Corcyraeans
feared that they might be hostile vessels; but they soon knew them, and
the ships came to anchor.

The next day the thirty Athenian vessels put out to sea, accompanied by
all the Corcyraean ships that were seaworthy, and sailed to the harbour
at Sybota, where the Corinthians lay, to see if they would engage. The
Corinthians put out from the land and formed a line in the open sea,
but beyond this made no further movement, having no intention of
assuming the offensive. For they saw reinforcements arrived fresh from
Athens, and themselves confronted by numerous difficulties, such as the
necessity of guarding the prisoners whom they had on board and the want
of all means of refitting their ships in a desert place. What they were
thinking more about was how their voyage home was to be effected; they
feared that the Athenians might consider that the treaty was dissolved
by the collision which had occurred, and forbid their departure.

Accordingly they resolved to put some men on board a boat, and send
them without a herald’s wand to the Athenians, as an experiment. Having
done so, they spoke as follows: “You do wrong, Athenians, to begin war
and break the treaty. Engaged in chastising our enemies, we find you
placing yourselves in our path in arms against us. Now if your
intentions are to prevent us sailing to Corcyra, or anywhere else that
we may wish, and if you are for breaking the treaty, first take us that
are here and treat us as enemies.” Such was what they said, and all the
Corcyraean armament that were within hearing immediately called out to
take them and kill them. But the Athenians answered as follows:
“Neither are we beginning war, Peloponnesians, nor are we breaking the
treaty; but these Corcyraeans are our allies, and we are come to help
them. So if you want to sail anywhere else, we place no obstacle in
your way; but if you are going to sail against Corcyra, or any of her
possessions, we shall do our best to stop you.”

Receiving this answer from the Athenians, the Corinthians commenced
preparations for their voyage home, and set up a trophy in Sybota, on
the continent; while the Corcyraeans took up the wrecks and dead that
had been carried out to them by the current, and by a wind which rose
in the night and scattered them in all directions, and set up their
trophy in Sybota, on the island, as victors. The reasons each side had
for claiming the victory were these. The Corinthians had been
victorious in the sea-fight until night; and having thus been enabled
to carry off most wrecks and dead, they were in possession of no fewer
than a thousand prisoners of war, and had sunk close upon seventy
vessels. The Corcyraeans had destroyed about thirty ships, and after
the arrival of the Athenians had taken up the wrecks and dead on their
side; they had besides seen the Corinthians retire before them, backing
water on sight of the Athenian vessels, and upon the arrival of the
Athenians refuse to sail out against them from Sybota. Thus both sides
claimed the victory.

The Corinthians on the voyage home took Anactorium, which stands at the
mouth of the Ambracian gulf. The place was taken by treachery, being
common ground to the Corcyraeans and Corinthians. After establishing
Corinthian settlers there, they retired home. Eight hundred of the
Corcyraeans were slaves; these they sold; two hundred and fifty they
retained in captivity, and treated with great attention, in the hope
that they might bring over their country to Corinth on their return;
most of them being, as it happened, men of very high position in
Corcyra. In this way Corcyra maintained her political existence in the
war with Corinth, and the Athenian vessels left the island. This was
the first cause of the war that Corinth had against the Athenians,
viz., that they had fought against them with the Corcyraeans in time of
treaty.

Almost immediately after this, fresh differences arose between the
Athenians and Peloponnesians, and contributed their share to the war.
Corinth was forming schemes for retaliation, and Athens suspected her
hostility. The Potidæans, who inhabit the isthmus of Pallene, being a
Corinthian colony, but tributary allies of Athens, were ordered to raze
the wall looking towards Pallene, to give hostages, to dismiss the
Corinthian magistrates, and in future not to receive the persons sent
from Corinth annually to succeed them. It was feared that they might be
persuaded by Perdiccas and the Corinthians to revolt, and might draw
the rest of the allies in the direction of Thrace to revolt with them.
These precautions against the Potidæans were taken by the Athenians
immediately after the battle at Corcyra. Not only was Corinth at length
openly hostile, but Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of the
Macedonians, had from an old friend and ally been made an enemy. He had
been made an enemy by the Athenians entering into alliance with his
brother Philip and Derdas, who were in league against him. In his alarm
he had sent to Lacedaemon to try and involve the Athenians in a war
with the Peloponnesians, and was endeavouring to win over Corinth in
order to bring about the revolt of Potidæa. He also made overtures to
the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace, and to the Bottiaeans, to
persuade them to join in the revolt; for he thought that if these
places on the border could be made his allies, it would be easier to
carry on the war with their co-operation. Alive to all this, and
wishing to anticipate the revolt of the cities, the Athenians acted as
follows. They were just then sending off thirty ships and a thousand
heavy infantry for his country under the command of Archestratus, son
of Lycomedes, with four colleagues. They instructed the captains to
take hostages of the Potidæans, to raze the wall, and to be on their
guard against the revolt of the neighbouring cities.

Meanwhile the Potidæans sent envoys to Athens on the chance of
persuading them to take no new steps in their matters; they also went
to Lacedaemon with the Corinthians to secure support in case of need.
Failing after prolonged negotiation to obtain anything satisfactory
from the Athenians; being unable, for all they could say, to prevent
the vessels that were destined for Macedonia from also sailing against
them; and receiving from the Lacedaemonian government a promise to
invade Attica, if the Athenians should attack Potidæa, the Potidæans,
thus favoured by the moment, at last entered into league with the
Chalcidians and Bottiaeans, and revolted. And Perdiccas induced the
Chalcidians to abandon and demolish their towns on the seaboard and,
settling inland at Olynthus, to make that one city a strong place:
meanwhile to those who followed his advice he gave a part of his
territory in Mygdonia round Lake Bolbe as a place of abode while the
war against the Athenians should last. They accordingly demolished
their towns, removed inland and prepared for war. The thirty ships of
the Athenians, arriving before the Thracian places, found Potidæa and
the rest in revolt. Their commanders, considering it to be quite
impossible with their present force to carry on war with Perdiccas and
with the confederate towns as well turned to Macedonia, their original
destination, and, having established themselves there, carried on war
in co-operation with Philip, and the brothers of Derdas, who had
invaded the country from the interior.

Meanwhile the Corinthians, with Potidæa in revolt and the Athenian
ships on the coast of Macedonia, alarmed for the safety of the place
and thinking its danger theirs, sent volunteers from Corinth, and
mercenaries from the rest of Peloponnese, to the number of sixteen
hundred heavy infantry in all, and four hundred light troops. Aristeus,
son of Adimantus, who was always a steady friend to the Potidæans, took
command of the expedition, and it was principally for love of him that
most of the men from Corinth volunteered. They arrived in Thrace forty
days after the revolt of Potidæa.

The Athenians also immediately received the news of the revolt of the
cities. On being informed that Aristeus and his reinforcements were on
their way, they sent two thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens
and forty ships against the places in revolt, under the command of
Callias, son of Calliades, and four colleagues. They arrived in
Macedonia first, and found the force of a thousand men that had been
first sent out, just become masters of Therme and besieging Pydna.
Accordingly they also joined in the investment, and besieged Pydna for
a while. Subsequently they came to terms and concluded a forced
alliance with Perdiccas, hastened by the calls of Potidæa and by the
arrival of Aristeus at that place. They withdrew from Macedonia, going
to Beroea and thence to Strepsa, and, after a futile attempt on the
latter place, they pursued by land their march to Potidæa with three
thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens, besides a number of
their allies, and six hundred Macedonian horsemen, the followers of
Philip and Pausanias. With these sailed seventy ships along the coast.
Advancing by short marches, on the third day they arrived at Gigonus,
where they encamped.

Meanwhile the Potidæans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus were
encamped on the side looking towards Olynthus on the isthmus, in
expectation of the Athenians, and had established their market outside
the city. The allies had chosen Aristeus general of all the infantry;
while the command of the cavalry was given to Perdiccas, who had at
once left the alliance of the Athenians and gone back to that of the
Potidæans, having deputed Iolaus as his general: The plan of Aristeus
was to keep his own force on the isthmus, and await the attack of the
Athenians; leaving the Chalcidians and the allies outside the isthmus,
and the two hundred cavalry from Perdiccas in Olynthus to act upon the
Athenian rear, on the occasion of their advancing against him; and thus
to place the enemy between two fires. While Callias the Athenian
general and his colleagues dispatched the Macedonian horse and a few of
the allies to Olynthus, to prevent any movement being made from that
quarter, the Athenians themselves broke up their camp and marched
against Potidæa. After they had arrived at the isthmus, and saw the
enemy preparing for battle, they formed against him, and soon
afterwards engaged. The wing of Aristeus, with the Corinthians and
other picked troops round him, routed the wing opposed to it, and
followed for a considerable distance in pursuit. But the rest of the
army of the Potidæans and of the Peloponnesians was defeated by the
Athenians, and took refuge within the fortifications. Returning from
the pursuit, Aristeus perceived the defeat of the rest of the army.
Being at a loss which of the two risks to choose, whether to go to
Olynthus or to Potidæa, he at last determined to draw his men into as
small a space as possible, and force his way with a run into Potidæa.
Not without difficulty, through a storm of missiles, he passed along by
the breakwater through the sea, and brought off most of his men safe,
though a few were lost. Meanwhile the auxiliaries of the Potidæans from
Olynthus, which is about seven miles off and in sight of Potidæa, when
the battle began and the signals were raised, advanced a little way to
render assistance; and the Macedonian horse formed against them to
prevent it. But on victory speedily declaring for the Athenians and the
signals being taken down, they retired back within the wall; and the
Macedonians returned to the Athenians. Thus there were no cavalry
present on either side. After the battle the Athenians set up a trophy,
and gave back their dead to the Potidæans under truce. The Potidæans
and their allies had close upon three hundred killed; the Athenians a
hundred and fifty of their own citizens, and Callias their general.

The wall on the side of the isthmus had now works at once raised
against it, and manned by the Athenians. That on the side of Pallene
had no works raised against it. They did not think themselves strong
enough at once to keep a garrison in the isthmus and to cross over to
Pallene and raise works there; they were afraid that the Potidæans and
their allies might take advantage of their division to attack them.
Meanwhile the Athenians at home learning that there were no works at
Pallene, some time afterwards sent off sixteen hundred heavy infantry
of their own citizens under the command of Phormio, son of Asopius.
Arrived at Pallene, he fixed his headquarters at Aphytis, and led his
army against Potidæa by short marches, ravaging the country as he
advanced. No one venturing to meet him in the field, he raised works
against the wall on the side of Pallene. So at length Potidæa was
strongly invested on either side, and from the sea by the ships
co-operating in the blockade. Aristeus, seeing its investment complete,
and having no hope of its salvation, except in the event of some
movement from the Peloponnese, or of some other improbable contingency,
advised all except five hundred to watch for a wind and sail out of the
place, in order that their provisions might last the longer. He was
willing to be himself one of those who remained. Unable to persuade
them, and desirous of acting on the next alternative, and of having
things outside in the best posture possible, he eluded the guardships
of the Athenians and sailed out. Remaining among the Chalcidians, he
continued to carry on the war; in particular he laid an ambuscade near
the city of the Sermylians, and cut off many of them; he also
communicated with Peloponnese, and tried to contrive some method by
which help might be brought. Meanwhile, after the completion of the
investment of Potidæa, Phormio next employed his sixteen hundred men in
ravaging Chalcidice and Bottica: some of the towns also were taken by
him.




CHAPTER III


Congress of the Peloponnesian Confederacy at Lacedaemon


The Athenians and Peloponnesians had these antecedent grounds of
complaint against each other: the complaint of Corinth was that her
colony of Potidæa, and Corinthian and Peloponnesian citizens within it,
were being besieged; that of Athens against the Peloponnesians that
they had incited a town of hers, a member of her alliance and a
contributor to her revenue, to revolt, and had come and were openly
fighting against her on the side of the Potidæans. For all this, war
had not yet broken out: there was still truce for a while; for this was
a private enterprise on the part of Corinth.

But the siege of Potidæa put an end to her inaction; she had men inside
it: besides, she feared for the place. Immediately summoning the allies
to Lacedaemon, she came and loudly accused Athens of breach of the
treaty and aggression on the rights of Peloponnese. With her, the
Aeginetans, formally unrepresented from fear of Athens, in secret
proved not the least urgent of the advocates for war, asserting that
they had not the independence guaranteed to them by the treaty. After
extending the summons to any of their allies and others who might have
complaints to make of Athenian aggression, the Lacedaemonians held
their ordinary assembly, and invited them to speak. There were many who
came forward and made their several accusations; among them the
Megarians, in a long list of grievances, called special attention to
the fact of their exclusion from the ports of the Athenian empire and
the market of Athens, in defiance of the treaty. Last of all the
Corinthians came forward, and having let those who preceded them
inflame the Lacedaemonians, now followed with a speech to this effect:

“Lacedaemonians! the confidence which you feel in your constitution and
social order, inclines you to receive any reflections of ours on other
powers with a certain scepticism. Hence springs your moderation, but
hence also the rather limited knowledge which you betray in dealing
with foreign politics. Time after time was our voice raised to warn you
of the blows about to be dealt us by Athens, and time after time,
instead of taking the trouble to ascertain the worth of our
communications, you contented yourselves with suspecting the speakers
of being inspired by private interest. And so, instead of calling these
allies together before the blow fell, you have delayed to do so till we
are smarting under it; allies among whom we have not the worst title to
speak, as having the greatest complaints to make, complaints of
Athenian outrage and Lacedaemonian neglect. Now if these assaults on
the rights of Hellas had been made in the dark, you might be
unacquainted with the facts, and it would be our duty to enlighten you.
As it is, long speeches are not needed where you see servitude
accomplished for some of us, meditated for others—in particular for our
allies—and prolonged preparations in the aggressor against the hour of
war. Or what, pray, is the meaning of their reception of Corcyra by
fraud, and their holding it against us by force? what of the siege of
Potidæa?—places one of which lies most conveniently for any action
against the Thracian towns; while the other would have contributed a
very large navy to the Peloponnesians?

“For all this you are responsible. You it was who first allowed them to
fortify their city after the Median war, and afterwards to erect the
long walls—you who, then and now, are always depriving of freedom not
only those whom they have enslaved, but also those who have as yet been
your allies. For the true author of the subjugation of a people is not
so much the immediate agent, as the power which permits it having the
means to prevent it; particularly if that power aspires to the glory of
being the liberator of Hellas. We are at last assembled. It has not
been easy to assemble, nor even now are our objects defined. We ought
not to be still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs, but into the
means of our defence. For the aggressors with matured plans to oppose
to our indecision have cast threats aside and betaken themselves to
action. And we know what are the paths by which Athenian aggression
travels, and how insidious is its progress. A degree of confidence she
may feel from the idea that your bluntness of perception prevents your
noticing her; but it is nothing to the impulse which her advance will
receive from the knowledge that you see, but do not care to interfere.
You, Lacedaemonians, of all the Hellenes are alone inactive, and defend
yourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do
something; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice
its original size, instead of crushing it in its infancy. And yet the
world used to say that you were to be depended upon; but in your case,
we fear, it said more than the truth. The Mede, we ourselves know, had
time to come from the ends of the earth to Peloponnese, without any
force of yours worthy of the name advancing to meet him. But this was a
distant enemy. Well, Athens at all events is a near neighbour, and yet
Athens you utterly disregard; against Athens you prefer to act on the
defensive instead of on the offensive, and to make it an affair of
chances by deferring the struggle till she has grown far stronger than
at first. And yet you know that on the whole the rock on which the
barbarian was wrecked was himself, and that if our present enemy Athens
has not again and again annihilated us, we owe it more to her blunders
than to your protection; Indeed, expectations from you have before now
been the ruin of some, whose faith induced them to omit preparation.

“We hope that none of you will consider these words of remonstrance to
be rather words of hostility; men remonstrate with friends who are in
error, accusations they reserve for enemies who have wronged them.
Besides, we consider that we have as good a right as any one to point
out a neighbour’s faults, particularly when we contemplate the great
contrast between the two national characters; a contrast of which, as
far as we can see, you have little perception, having never yet
considered what sort of antagonists you will encounter in the
Athenians, how widely, how absolutely different from yourselves. The
Athenians are addicted to innovation, and their designs are
characterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution; you have
a genius for keeping what you have got, accompanied by a total want of
invention, and when forced to act you never go far enough. Again, they
are adventurous beyond their power, and daring beyond their judgment,
and in danger they are sanguine; your wont is to attempt less than is
justified by your power, to mistrust even what is sanctioned by your
judgment, and to fancy that from danger there is no release. Further,
there is promptitude on their side against procrastination on yours;
they are never at home, you are never from it: for they hope by their
absence to extend their acquisitions, you fear by your advance to
endanger what you have left behind. They are swift to follow up a
success, and slow to recoil from a reverse. Their bodies they spend
ungrudgingly in their country’s cause; their intellect they jealously
husband to be employed in her service. A scheme unexecuted is with them
a positive loss, a successful enterprise a comparative failure. The
deficiency created by the miscarriage of an undertaking is soon filled
up by fresh hopes; for they alone are enabled to call a thing hoped for
a thing got, by the speed with which they act upon their resolutions.
Thus they toil on in trouble and danger all the days of their life,
with little opportunity for enjoying, being ever engaged in getting:
their only idea of a holiday is to do what the occasion demands, and to
them laborious occupation is less of a misfortune than the peace of a
quiet life. To describe their character in a word, one might truly say
that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to
give none to others.

“Such is Athens, your antagonist. And yet, Lacedaemonians, you still
delay, and fail to see that peace stays longest with those, who are not
more careful to use their power justly than to show their determination
not to submit to injustice. On the contrary, your ideal of fair dealing
is based on the principle that, if you do not injure others, you need
not risk your own fortunes in preventing others from injuring you. Now
you could scarcely have succeeded in such a policy even with a
neighbour like yourselves; but in the present instance, as we have just
shown, your habits are old-fashioned as compared with theirs. It is the
law as in art, so in politics, that improvements ever prevail; and
though fixed usages may be best for undisturbed communities, constant
necessities of action must be accompanied by the constant improvement
of methods. Thus it happens that the vast experience of Athens has
carried her further than you on the path of innovation.

“Here, at least, let your procrastination end. For the present, assist
your allies and Potidæa in particular, as you promised, by a speedy
invasion of Attica, and do not sacrifice friends and kindred to their
bitterest enemies, and drive the rest of us in despair to some other
alliance. Such a step would not be condemned either by the Gods who
received our oaths, or by the men who witnessed them. The breach of a
treaty cannot be laid to the people whom desertion compels to seek new
relations, but to the power that fails to assist its confederate. But
if you will only act, we will stand by you; it would be unnatural for
us to change, and never should we meet with such a congenial ally. For
these reasons choose the right course, and endeavour not to let
Peloponnese under your supremacy degenerate from the prestige that it
enjoyed under that of your ancestors.”

Such were the words of the Corinthians. There happened to be Athenian
envoys present at Lacedaemon on other business. On hearing the speeches
they thought themselves called upon to come before the Lacedaemonians.
Their intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which
the cities brought against them, but to show on a comprehensive view
that it was not a matter to be hastily decided on, but one that
demanded further consideration. There was also a wish to call attention
to the great power of Athens, and to refresh the memory of the old and
enlighten the ignorance of the young, from a notion that their words
might have the effect of inducing them to prefer tranquillity to war.
So they came to the Lacedaemonians and said that they too, if there was
no objection, wished to speak to their assembly. They replied by
inviting them to come forward. The Athenians advanced, and spoke as
follows:

“The object of our mission here was not to argue with your allies, but
to attend to the matters on which our state dispatched us. However, the
vehemence of the outcry that we hear against us has prevailed on us to
come forward. It is not to combat the accusations of the cities (indeed
you are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead), but to
prevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by
yielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies. We also wish to
show on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to
our possessions, and that our country has claims to consideration. We
need not refer to remote antiquity: there we could appeal to the voice
of tradition, but not to the experience of our audience. But to the
Median War and contemporary history we must refer, although we are
rather tired of continually bringing this subject forward. In our
action during that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages:
you had your share in the solid results, do not try to rob us of all
share in the good that the glory may do us. However, the story shall be
told not so much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it, and
to show, if you are so ill advised as to enter into a struggle with
Athens, what sort of an antagonist she is likely to prove. We assert
that at Marathon we were at the front, and faced the barbarian
single-handed. That when he came the second time, unable to cope with
him by land we went on board our ships with all our people, and joined
in the action at Salamis. This prevented his taking the Peloponnesian
states in detail, and ravaging them with his fleet; when the multitude
of his vessels would have made any combination for self-defence
impossible. The best proof of this was furnished by the invader
himself. Defeated at sea, he considered his power to be no longer what
it had been, and retired as speedily as possible with the greater part
of his army.

“Such, then, was the result of the matter, and it was clearly proved
that it was on the fleet of Hellas that her cause depended. Well, to
this result we contributed three very useful elements, viz., the
largest number of ships, the ablest commander, and the most
unhesitating patriotism. Our contingent of ships was little less than
two-thirds of the whole four hundred; the commander was Themistocles,
through whom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits,
the acknowledged salvation of our cause. Indeed, this was the reason of
your receiving him with honours such as had never been accorded to any
foreign visitor. While for daring patriotism we had no competitors.
Receiving no reinforcements from behind, seeing everything in front of
us already subjugated, we had the spirit, after abandoning our city,
after sacrificing our property (instead of deserting the remainder of
the league or depriving them of our services by dispersing), to throw
ourselves into our ships and meet the danger, without a thought of
resenting your neglect to assist us. We assert, therefore, that we
conferred on you quite as much as we received. For you had a stake to
fight for; the cities which you had left were still filled with your
homes, and you had the prospect of enjoying them again; and your coming
was prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us; at all
events, you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose. But we
left behind us a city that was a city no longer, and staked our lives
for a city that had an existence only in desperate hope, and so bore
our full share in your deliverance and in ours. But if we had copied
others, and allowed fears for our territory to make us give in our
adhesion to the Mede before you came, or if we had suffered our ruin to
break our spirit and prevent us embarking in our ships, your naval
inferiority would have made a sea-fight unnecessary, and his objects
would have been peaceably attained.

“Surely, Lacedaemonians, neither by the patriotism that we displayed at
that crisis, nor by the wisdom of our counsels, do we merit our extreme
unpopularity with the Hellenes, not at least unpopularity for our
empire. That empire we acquired by no violent means, but because you
were unwilling to prosecute to its conclusion the war against the
barbarian, and because the allies attached themselves to us and
spontaneously asked us to assume the command. And the nature of the
case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height;
fear being our principal motive, though honour and interest afterwards
came in. And at last, when almost all hated us, when some had already
revolted and had been subdued, when you had ceased to be the friends
that you once were, and had become objects of suspicion and dislike, it
appeared no longer safe to give up our empire; especially as all who
left us would fall to you. And no one can quarrel with a people for
making, in matters of tremendous risk, the best provision that it can
for its interest.

“You, at all events, Lacedaemonians, have used your supremacy to settle
the states in Peloponnese as is agreeable to you. And if at the period
of which we were speaking you had persevered to the end of the matter,
and had incurred hatred in your command, we are sure that you would
have made yourselves just as galling to the allies, and would have been
forced to choose between a strong government and danger to yourselves.
It follows that it was not a very wonderful action, or contrary to the
common practice of mankind, if we did accept an empire that was offered
to us, and refused to give it up under the pressure of three of the
strongest motives, fear, honour, and interest. And it was not we who
set the example, for it has always been law that the weaker should be
subject to the stronger. Besides, we believed ourselves to be worthy of
our position, and so you thought us till now, when calculations of
interest have made you take up the cry of justice—a consideration which
no one ever yet brought forward to hinder his ambition when he had a
chance of gaining anything by might. And praise is due to all who, if
not so superior to human nature as to refuse dominion, yet respect
justice more than their position compels them to do.

“We imagine that our moderation would be best demonstrated by the
conduct of others who should be placed in our position; but even our
equity has very unreasonably subjected us to condemnation instead of
approval. Our abatement of our rights in the contract trials with our
allies, and our causing them to be decided by impartial laws at Athens,
have gained us the character of being litigious. And none care to
inquire why this reproach is not brought against other imperial powers,
who treat their subjects with less moderation than we do; the secret
being that where force can be used, law is not needed. But our subjects
are so habituated to associate with us as equals that any defeat
whatever that clashes with their notions of justice, whether it
proceeds from a legal judgment or from the power which our empire gives
us, makes them forget to be grateful for being allowed to retain most
of their possessions, and more vexed at a part being taken, than if we
had from the first cast law aside and openly gratified our
covetousness. If we had done so, not even would they have disputed that
the weaker must give way to the stronger. Men’s indignation, it seems,
is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks
like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a
superior. At all events they contrived to put up with much worse
treatment than this from the Mede, yet they think our rule severe, and
this is to be expected, for the present always weighs heavy on the
conquered. This at least is certain. If you were to succeed in
overthrowing us and in taking our place, you would speedily lose the
popularity with which fear of us has invested you, if your policy of
to-day is at all to tally with the sample that you gave of it during
the brief period of your command against the Mede. Not only is your
life at home regulated by rules and institutions incompatible with
those of others, but your citizens abroad act neither on these rules
nor on those which are recognized by the rest of Hellas.

“Take time then in forming your resolution, as the matter is of great
importance; and do not be persuaded by the opinions and complaints of
others to bring trouble on yourselves, but consider the vast influence
of accident in war, before you are engaged in it. As it continues, it
generally becomes an affair of chances, chances from which neither of
us is exempt, and whose event we must risk in the dark. It is a common
mistake in going to war to begin at the wrong end, to act first, and
wait for disaster to discuss the matter. But we are not yet by any
means so misguided, nor, so far as we can see, are you; accordingly,
while it is still open to us both to choose aright, we bid you not to
dissolve the treaty, or to break your oaths, but to have our
differences settled by arbitration according to our agreement. Or else
we take the gods who heard the oaths to witness, and if you begin
hostilities, whatever line of action you choose, we will try not to be
behindhand in repelling you.”

Such were the words of the Athenians. After the Lacedaemonians had
heard the complaints of the allies against the Athenians, and the
observations of the latter, they made all withdraw, and consulted by
themselves on the question before them. The opinions of the majority
all led to the same conclusion; the Athenians were open aggressors, and
war must be declared at once. But Archidamus, the Lacedaemonian king,
came forward, who had the reputation of being at once a wise and a
moderate man, and made the following speech:

“I have not lived so long, Lacedaemonians, without having had the
experience of many wars, and I see those among you of the same age as
myself, who will not fall into the common misfortune of longing for war
from inexperience or from a belief in its advantage and its safety.
This, the war on which you are now debating, would be one of the
greatest magnitude, on a sober consideration of the matter. In a
struggle with Peloponnesians and neighbours our strength is of the same
character, and it is possible to move swiftly on the different points.
But a struggle with a people who live in a distant land, who have also
an extraordinary familiarity with the sea, and who are in the highest
state of preparation in every other department; with wealth private and
public, with ships, and horses, and heavy infantry, and a population
such as no one other Hellenic place can equal, and lastly a number of
tributary allies—what can justify us in rashly beginning such a
struggle? wherein is our trust that we should rush on it unprepared? Is
it in our ships? There we are inferior; while if we are to practise and
become a match for them, time must intervene. Is it in our money? There
we have a far greater deficiency. We neither have it in our treasury,
nor are we ready to contribute it from our private funds. Confidence
might possibly be felt in our superiority in heavy infantry and
population, which will enable us to invade and devastate their lands.
But the Athenians have plenty of other land in their empire, and can
import what they want by sea. Again, if we are to attempt an
insurrection of their allies, these will have to be supported with a
fleet, most of them being islanders. What then is to be our war? For
unless we can either beat them at sea, or deprive them of the revenues
which feed their navy, we shall meet with little but disaster.
Meanwhile our honour will be pledged to keeping on, particularly if it
be the opinion that we began the quarrel. For let us never be elated by
the fatal hope of the war being quickly ended by the devastation of
their lands. I fear rather that we may leave it as a legacy to our
children; so improbable is it that the Athenian spirit will be the
slave of their land, or Athenian experience be cowed by war.

“Not that I would bid you be so unfeeling as to suffer them to injure
your allies, and to refrain from unmasking their intrigues; but I do
bid you not to take up arms at once, but to send and remonstrate with
them in a tone not too suggestive of war, nor again too suggestive of
submission, and to employ the interval in perfecting our own
preparations. The means will be, first, the acquisition of allies,
Hellenic or barbarian it matters not, so long as they are an accession
to our strength naval or pecuniary—I say Hellenic or barbarian, because
the odium of such an accession to all who like us are the objects of
the designs of the Athenians is taken away by the law of
self-preservation—and secondly the development of our home resources.
If they listen to our embassy, so much the better; but if not, after
the lapse of two or three years our position will have become
materially strengthened, and we can then attack them if we think
proper. Perhaps by that time the sight of our preparations, backed by
language equally significant, will have disposed them to submission,
while their land is still untouched, and while their counsels may be
directed to the retention of advantages as yet undestroyed. For the
only light in which you can view their land is that of a hostage in
your hands, a hostage the more valuable the better it is cultivated.
This you ought to spare as long as possible, and not make them
desperate, and so increase the difficulty of dealing with them. For if
while still unprepared, hurried away by the complaints of our allies,
we are induced to lay it waste, have a care that we do not bring deep
disgrace and deep perplexity upon Peloponnese. Complaints, whether of
communities or individuals, it is possible to adjust; but war
undertaken by a coalition for sectional interests, whose progress there
is no means of foreseeing, does not easily admit of creditable
settlement.

“And none need think it cowardice for a number of confederates to pause
before they attack a single city. The Athenians have allies as numerous
as our own, and allies that pay tribute, and war is a matter not so
much of arms as of money, which makes arms of use. And this is more
than ever true in a struggle between a continental and a maritime
power. First, then, let us provide money, and not allow ourselves to be
carried away by the talk of our allies before we have done so: as we
shall have the largest share of responsibility for the consequences be
they good or bad, we have also a right to a tranquil inquiry respecting
them.

“And the slowness and procrastination, the parts of our character that
are most assailed by their criticism, need not make you blush. If we
undertake the war without preparation, we should by hastening its
commencement only delay its conclusion: further, a free and a famous
city has through all time been ours. The quality which they condemn is
really nothing but a wise moderation; thanks to its possession, we
alone do not become insolent in success and give way less than others
in misfortune; we are not carried away by the pleasure of hearing
ourselves cheered on to risks which our judgment condemns; nor, if
annoyed, are we any the more convinced by attempts to exasperate us by
accusation. We are both warlike and wise, and it is our sense of order
that makes us so. We are warlike, because self-control contains honour
as a chief constituent, and honour bravery. And we are wise, because we
are educated with too little learning to despise the laws, and with too
severe a self-control to disobey them, and are brought up not to be too
knowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a
specious criticism of an enemy’s plans in theory, but fails to assail
them with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the
schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own, and that the
freaks of chance are not determinable by calculation. In practice we
always base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that
his plans are good; indeed, it is right to rest our hopes not on a
belief in his blunders, but on the soundness of our provisions. Nor
ought we to believe that there is much difference between man and man,
but to think that the superiority lies with him who is reared in the
severest school. These practices, then, which our ancestors have
delivered to us, and by whose maintenance we have always profited, must
not be given up. And we must not be hurried into deciding in a day’s
brief space a question which concerns many lives and fortunes and many
cities, and in which honour is deeply involved—but we must decide
calmly. This our strength peculiarly enables us to do. As for the
Athenians, send to them on the matter of Potidæa, send on the matter of
the alleged wrongs of the allies, particularly as they are prepared
with legal satisfaction; and to proceed against one who offers
arbitration as against a wrongdoer, law forbids. Meanwhile do not omit
preparation for war. This decision will be the best for yourselves, the
most terrible to your opponents.”

Such were the words of Archidamus. Last came forward Sthenelaidas, one
of the ephors for that year, and spoke to the Lacedaemonians as
follows:

“The long speech of the Athenians I do not pretend to understand. They
said a good deal in praise of themselves, but nowhere denied that they
are injuring our allies and Peloponnese. And yet if they behaved well
against the Mede then, but ill towards us now, they deserve double
punishment for having ceased to be good and for having become bad. We
meanwhile are the same then and now, and shall not, if we are wise,
disregard the wrongs of our allies, or put off till to-morrow the duty
of assisting those who must suffer to-day. Others have much money and
ships and horses, but we have good allies whom we must not give up to
the Athenians, nor by lawsuits and words decide the matter, as it is
anything but in word that we are harmed, but render instant and
powerful help. And let us not be told that it is fitting for us to
deliberate under injustice; long deliberation is rather fitting for
those who have injustice in contemplation. Vote therefore,
Lacedaemonians, for war, as the honour of Sparta demands, and neither
allow the further aggrandizement of Athens, nor betray our allies to
ruin, but with the gods let us advance against the aggressors.”

With these words he, as ephor, himself put the question to the assembly
of the Lacedaemonians. He said that he could not determine which was
the loudest acclamation (their mode of decision is by acclamation not
by voting); the fact being that he wished to make them declare their
opinion openly and thus to increase their ardour for war. Accordingly
he said: “All Lacedaemonians who are of opinion that the treaty has
been broken, and that Athens is guilty, leave your seats and go there,”
pointing out a certain place; “all who are of the opposite opinion,
there.” They accordingly stood up and divided; and those who held that
the treaty had been broken were in a decided majority. Summoning the
allies, they told them that their opinion was that Athens had been
guilty of injustice, but that they wished to convoke all the allies and
put it to the vote; in order that they might make war, if they decided
to do so, on a common resolution. Having thus gained their point, the
delegates returned home at once; the Athenian envoys a little later,
when they had dispatched the objects of their mission. This decision of
the assembly, judging that the treaty had been broken, was made in the
fourteenth year of the thirty years’ truce, which was entered into
after the affair of Euboea.

The Lacedaemonians voted that the treaty had been broken, and that the
war must be declared, not so much because they were persuaded by the
arguments of the allies, as because they feared the growth of the power
of the Athenians, seeing most of Hellas already subject to them.




CHAPTER IV


From the end of the Persian to the beginning of the Peloponnesian
War—The Progress from Supremacy to Empire


The way in which Athens came to be placed in the circumstances under
which her power grew was this. After the Medes had returned from
Europe, defeated by sea and land by the Hellenes, and after those of
them who had fled with their ships to Mycale had been destroyed,
Leotychides, king of the Lacedaemonians, the commander of the Hellenes
at Mycale, departed home with the allies from Peloponnese. But the
Athenians and the allies from Ionia and Hellespont, who had now
revolted from the King, remained and laid siege to Sestos, which was
still held by the Medes. After wintering before it, they became masters
of the place on its evacuation by the barbarians; and after this they
sailed away from Hellespont to their respective cities. Meanwhile the
Athenian people, after the departure of the barbarian from their
country, at once proceeded to carry over their children and wives, and
such property as they had left, from the places where they had
deposited them, and prepared to rebuild their city and their walls. For
only isolated portions of the circumference had been left standing, and
most of the houses were in ruins; though a few remained, in which the
Persian grandees had taken up their quarters.

Perceiving what they were going to do, the Lacedaemonians sent an
embassy to Athens. They would have themselves preferred to see neither
her nor any other city in possession of a wall; though here they acted
principally at the instigation of their allies, who were alarmed at the
strength of her newly acquired navy and the valour which she had
displayed in the war with the Medes. They begged her not only to
abstain from building walls for herself, but also to join them in
throwing down the walls that still held together of the
ultra-Peloponnesian cities. The real meaning of their advice, the
suspicion that it contained against the Athenians, was not proclaimed;
it was urged that so the barbarian, in the event of a third invasion,
would not have any strong place, such as he now had in Thebes, for his
base of operations; and that Peloponnese would suffice for all as a
base both for retreat and offence. After the Lacedaemonians had thus
spoken, they were, on the advice of Themistocles, immediately dismissed
by the Athenians, with the answer that ambassadors should be sent to
Sparta to discuss the question. Themistocles told the Athenians to send
him off with all speed to Lacedaemon, but not to dispatch his
colleagues as soon as they had selected them, but to wait until they
had raised their wall to the height from which defence was possible.
Meanwhile the whole population in the city was to labour at the wall,
the Athenians, their wives, and their children, sparing no edifice,
private or public, which might be of any use to the work, but throwing
all down. After giving these instructions, and adding that he would be
responsible for all other matters there, he departed. Arrived at
Lacedaemon he did not seek an audience with the authorities, but tried
to gain time and made excuses. When any of the government asked him why
he did not appear in the assembly, he would say that he was waiting for
his colleagues, who had been detained in Athens by some engagement;
however, that he expected their speedy arrival, and wondered that they
were not yet there. At first the Lacedaemonians trusted the words of
Themistocles, through their friendship for him; but when others
arrived, all distinctly declaring that the work was going on and
already attaining some elevation, they did not know how to disbelieve
it. Aware of this, he told them that rumours are deceptive, and should
not be trusted; they should send some reputable persons from Sparta to
inspect, whose report might be trusted. They dispatched them
accordingly. Concerning these Themistocles secretly sent word to the
Athenians to detain them as far as possible without putting them under
open constraint, and not to let them go until they had themselves
returned. For his colleagues had now joined him, Abronichus, son of
Lysicles, and Aristides, son of Lysimachus, with the news that the wall
was sufficiently advanced; and he feared that when the Lacedaemonians
heard the facts, they might refuse to let them go. So the Athenians
detained the envoys according to his message, and Themistocles had an
audience with the Lacedaemonians, and at last openly told them that
Athens was now fortified sufficiently to protect its inhabitants; that
any embassy which the Lacedaemonians or their allies might wish to send
to them should in future proceed on the assumption that the people to
whom they were going was able to distinguish both its own and the
general interests. That when the Athenians thought fit to abandon their
city and to embark in their ships, they ventured on that perilous step
without consulting them; and that on the other hand, wherever they had
deliberated with the Lacedaemonians, they had proved themselves to be
in judgment second to none. That they now thought it fit that their
city should have a wall, and that this would be more for the advantage
of both the citizens of Athens and the Hellenic confederacy; for
without equal military strength it was impossible to contribute equal
or fair counsel to the common interest. It followed, he observed,
either that all the members of the confederacy should be without walls,
or that the present step should be considered a right one.

The Lacedaemonians did not betray any open signs of anger against the
Athenians at what they heard. The embassy, it seems, was prompted not
by a desire to obstruct, but to guide the counsels of their government:
besides, Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards Athens
on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle
with the Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause
them secret annoyance. The envoys of each state departed home without
complaint.

In this way the Athenians walled their city in a little while. To this
day the building shows signs of the haste of its execution; the
foundations are laid of stones of all kinds, and in some places not
wrought or fitted, but placed just in the order in which they were
brought by the different hands; and many columns, too, from tombs, and
sculptured stones were put in with the rest. For the bounds of the city
were extended at every point of the circumference; and so they laid
hands on everything without exception in their haste. Themistocles also
persuaded them to finish the walls of Piraeus, which had been begun
before, in his year of office as archon; being influenced alike by the
fineness of a locality that has three natural harbours, and by the
great start which the Athenians would gain in the acquisition of power
by becoming a naval people. For he first ventured to tell them to stick
to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire. It
was by his advice, too, that they built the walls of that thickness
which can still be discerned round Piraeus, the stones being brought up
by two wagons meeting each other. Between the walls thus formed there
was neither rubble nor mortar, but great stones hewn square and fitted
together, cramped to each other on the outside with iron and lead.
About half the height that he intended was finished. His idea was by
their size and thickness to keep off the attacks of an enemy; he
thought that they might be adequately defended by a small garrison of
invalids, and the rest be freed for service in the fleet. For the fleet
claimed most of his attention. He saw, as I think, that the approach by
sea was easier for the king’s army than that by land: he also thought
Piraeus more valuable than the upper city; indeed, he was always
advising the Athenians, if a day should come when they were hard
pressed by land, to go down into Piraeus, and defy the world with their
fleet. Thus, therefore, the Athenians completed their wall, and
commenced their other buildings immediately after the retreat of the
Mede.

Meanwhile Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, was sent out from Lacedaemon
as commander-in-chief of the Hellenes, with twenty ships from
Peloponnese. With him sailed the Athenians with thirty ships, and a
number of the other allies. They made an expedition against Cyprus and
subdued most of the island, and afterwards against Byzantium, which was
in the hands of the Medes, and compelled it to surrender. This event
took place while the Spartans were still supreme. But the violence of
Pausanias had already begun to be disagreeable to the Hellenes,
particularly to the Ionians and the newly liberated populations. These
resorted to the Athenians and requested them as their kinsmen to become
their leaders, and to stop any attempt at violence on the part of
Pausanias. The Athenians accepted their overtures, and determined to
put down any attempt of the kind and to settle everything else as their
interests might seem to demand. In the meantime the Lacedaemonians
recalled Pausanias for an investigation of the reports which had
reached them. Manifold and grave accusations had been brought against
him by Hellenes arriving in Sparta; and, to all appearance, there had
been in him more of the mimicry of a despot than of the attitude of a
general. As it happened, his recall came just at the time when the
hatred which he had inspired had induced the allies to desert him, the
soldiers from Peloponnese excepted, and to range themselves by the side
of the Athenians. On his arrival at Lacedaemon, he was censured for his
private acts of oppression, but was acquitted on the heaviest counts
and pronounced not guilty; it must be known that the charge of Medism
formed one of the principal, and to all appearance one of the best
founded, articles against him. The Lacedaemonians did not, however,
restore him to his command, but sent out Dorkis and certain others with
a small force; who found the allies no longer inclined to concede to
them the supremacy. Perceiving this they departed, and the
Lacedaemonians did not send out any to succeed them. They feared for
those who went out a deterioration similar to that observable in
Pausanias; besides, they desired to be rid of the Median War, and were
satisfied of the competency of the Athenians for the position, and of
their friendship at the time towards themselves.

The Athenians, having thus succeeded to the supremacy by the voluntary
act of the allies through their hatred of Pausanias, fixed which cities
were to contribute money against the barbarian, which ships; their
professed object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging
the King’s country. Now was the time that the office of “Treasurers for
Hellas” was first instituted by the Athenians. These officers received
the tribute, as the money contributed was called. The tribute was first
fixed at four hundred and sixty talents. The common treasury was at
Delos, and the congresses were held in the temple. Their supremacy
commenced with independent allies who acted on the resolutions of a
common congress. It was marked by the following undertakings in war and
in administration during the interval between the Median and the
present war, against the barbarian, against their own rebel allies, and
against the Peloponnesian powers which would come in contact with them
on various occasions. My excuse for relating these events, and for
venturing on this digression, is that this passage of history has been
omitted by all my predecessors, who have confined themselves either to
Hellenic history before the Median War, or the Median War itself.
Hellanicus, it is true, did touch on these events in his Athenian
history; but he is somewhat concise and not accurate in his dates.
Besides, the history of these events contains an explanation of the
growth of the Athenian empire.

First the Athenians besieged and captured Eion on the Strymon from the
Medes, and made slaves of the inhabitants, being under the command of
Cimon, son of Miltiades. Next they enslaved Scyros, the island in the
Aegean, containing a Dolopian population, and colonized it themselves.
This was followed by a war against Carystus, in which the rest of
Euboea remained neutral, and which was ended by surrender on
conditions. After this Naxos left the confederacy, and a war ensued,
and she had to return after a siege; this was the first instance of the
engagement being broken by the subjugation of an allied city, a
precedent which was followed by that of the rest in the order which
circumstances prescribed. Of all the causes of defection, that
connected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of
service, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and
exacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of
necessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any
continuous labour. In some other respects the Athenians were not the
old popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than
their fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to
reduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. For this the allies had
themselves to blame; the wish to get off service making most of them
arrange to pay their share of the expense in money instead of in ships,
and so to avoid having to leave their homes. Thus while Athens was
increasing her navy with the funds which they contributed, a revolt
always found them without resources or experience for war.

Next we come to the actions by land and by sea at the river Eurymedon,
between the Athenians with their allies, and the Medes, when the
Athenians won both battles on the same day under the conduct of Cimon,
son of Miltiades, and captured and destroyed the whole Phoenician
fleet, consisting of two hundred vessels. Some time afterwards occurred
the defection of the Thasians, caused by disagreements about the marts
on the opposite coast of Thrace, and about the mine in their
possession. Sailing with a fleet to Thasos, the Athenians defeated them
at sea and effected a landing on the island. About the same time they
sent ten thousand settlers of their own citizens and the allies to
settle the place then called Ennea Hodoi or Nine Ways, now Amphipolis.
They succeeded in gaining possession of Ennea Hodoi from the Edonians,
but on advancing into the interior of Thrace were cut off in Drabescus,
a town of the Edonians, by the assembled Thracians, who regarded the
settlement of the place Ennea Hodoi as an act of hostility. Meanwhile
the Thasians being defeated in the field and suffering siege, appealed
to Lacedaemon, and desired her to assist them by an invasion of Attica.
Without informing Athens, she promised and intended to do so, but was
prevented by the occurrence of the earthquake, accompanied by the
secession of the Helots and the Thuriats and Aethaeans of the Perioeci
to Ithome. Most of the Helots were the descendants of the old
Messenians that were enslaved in the famous war; and so all of them
came to be called Messenians. So the Lacedaemonians being engaged in a
war with the rebels in Ithome, the Thasians in the third year of the
siege obtained terms from the Athenians by razing their walls,
delivering up their ships, and arranging to pay the moneys demanded at
once, and tribute in future; giving up their possessions on the
continent together with the mine.

The Lacedaemonians, meanwhile, finding the war against the rebels in
Ithome likely to last, invoked the aid of their allies, and especially
of the Athenians, who came in some force under the command of Cimon.
The reason for this pressing summons lay in their reputed skill in
siege operations; a long siege had taught the Lacedaemonians their own
deficiency in this art, else they would have taken the place by
assault. The first open quarrel between the Lacedaemonians and
Athenians arose out of this expedition. The Lacedaemonians, when
assault failed to take the place, apprehensive of the enterprising and
revolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them
as of alien extraction, began to fear that, if they remained, they
might be tempted by the besieged in Ithome to attempt some political
changes. They accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without
declaring their suspicions, but merely saying that they had now no need
of them. But the Athenians, aware that their dismissal did not proceed
from the more honourable reason of the two, but from suspicions which
had been conceived, went away deeply offended, and conscious of having
done nothing to merit such treatment from the Lacedaemonians; and the
instant that they returned home they broke off the alliance which had
been made against the Mede, and allied themselves with Sparta’s enemy
Argos; each of the contracting parties taking the same oaths and making
the same alliance with the Thessalians.

Meanwhile the rebels in Ithome, unable to prolong further a ten years’
resistance, surrendered to Lacedaemon; the conditions being that they
should depart from Peloponnese under safe conduct, and should never set
foot in it again: any one who might hereafter be found there was to be
the slave of his captor. It must be known that the Lacedaemonians had
an old oracle from Delphi, to the effect that they should let go the
suppliant of Zeus at Ithome. So they went forth with their children and
their wives, and being received by Athens from the hatred that she now
felt for the Lacedaemonians, were located at Naupactus, which she had
lately taken from the Ozolian Locrians. The Athenians received another
addition to their confederacy in the Megarians; who left the
Lacedaemonian alliance, annoyed by a war about boundaries forced on
them by Corinth. The Athenians occupied Megara and Pegae, and built the
Megarians their long walls from the city to Nisaea, in which they
placed an Athenian garrison. This was the principal cause of the
Corinthians conceiving such a deadly hatred against Athens.

Meanwhile Inaros, son of Psammetichus, a Libyan king of the Libyans on
the Egyptian border, having his headquarters at Marea, the town above
Pharos, caused a revolt of almost the whole of Egypt from King
Artaxerxes and, placing himself at its head, invited the Athenians to
his assistance. Abandoning a Cyprian expedition upon which they
happened to be engaged with two hundred ships of their own and their
allies, they arrived in Egypt and sailed from the sea into the Nile,
and making themselves masters of the river and two-thirds of Memphis,
addressed themselves to the attack of the remaining third, which is
called White Castle. Within it were Persians and Medes who had taken
refuge there, and Egyptians who had not joined the rebellion.

Meanwhile the Athenians, making a descent from their fleet upon Haliae,
were engaged by a force of Corinthians and Epidaurians; and the
Corinthians were victorious. Afterwards the Athenians engaged the
Peloponnesian fleet off Cecruphalia; and the Athenians were victorious.
Subsequently war broke out between Aegina and Athens, and there was a
great battle at sea off Aegina between the Athenians and Aeginetans,
each being aided by their allies; in which victory remained with the
Athenians, who took seventy of the enemy’s ships, and landed in the
country and commenced a siege under the command of Leocrates, son of
Stroebus. Upon this the Peloponnesians, desirous of aiding the
Aeginetans, threw into Aegina a force of three hundred heavy infantry,
who had before been serving with the Corinthians and Epidaurians.
Meanwhile the Corinthians and their allies occupied the heights of
Geraneia, and marched down into the Megarid, in the belief that, with a
large force absent in Aegina and Egypt, Athens would be unable to help
the Megarians without raising the siege of Aegina. But the Athenians,
instead of moving the army of Aegina, raised a force of the old and
young men that had been left in the city, and marched into the Megarid
under the command of Myronides. After a drawn battle with the
Corinthians, the rival hosts parted, each with the impression that they
had gained the victory. The Athenians, however, if anything, had rather
the advantage, and on the departure of the Corinthians set up a trophy.
Urged by the taunts of the elders in their city, the Corinthians made
their preparations, and about twelve days afterwards came and set up
their trophy as victors. Sallying out from Megara, the Athenians cut
off the party that was employed in erecting the trophy, and engaged and
defeated the rest. In the retreat of the vanquished army, a
considerable division, pressed by the pursuers and mistaking the road,
dashed into a field on some private property, with a deep trench all
round it, and no way out. Being acquainted with the place, the
Athenians hemmed their front with heavy infantry and, placing the light
troops round in a circle, stoned all who had gone in. Corinth here
suffered a severe blow. The bulk of her army continued its retreat
home.

About this time the Athenians began to build the long walls to the sea,
that towards Phalerum and that towards Piraeus. Meanwhile the Phocians
made an expedition against Doris, the old home of the Lacedaemonians,
containing the towns of Boeum, Kitinium, and Erineum. They had taken
one of these towns, when the Lacedaemonians under Nicomedes, son of
Cleombrotus, commanding for King Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, who was
still a minor, came to the aid of the Dorians with fifteen hundred
heavy infantry of their own, and ten thousand of their allies. After
compelling the Phocians to restore the town on conditions, they began
their retreat. The route by sea, across the Crissaean Gulf, exposed
them to the risk of being stopped by the Athenian fleet; that across
Geraneia seemed scarcely safe, the Athenians holding Megara and Pegae.
For the pass was a difficult one, and was always guarded by the
Athenians; and, in the present instance, the Lacedaemonians had
information that they meant to dispute their passage. So they resolved
to remain in Boeotia, and to consider which would be the safest line of
march. They had also another reason for this resolve. Secret
encouragement had been given them by a party in Athens, who hoped to
put an end to the reign of democracy and the building of the Long
Walls. Meanwhile the Athenians marched against them with their whole
levy and a thousand Argives and the respective contingents of the rest
of their allies. Altogether they were fourteen thousand strong. The
march was prompted by the notion that the Lacedaemonians were at a loss
how to effect their passage, and also by suspicions of an attempt to
overthrow the democracy. Some cavalry also joined the Athenians from
their Thessalian allies; but these went over to the Lacedaemonians
during the battle.

The battle was fought at Tanagra in Boeotia. After heavy loss on both
sides, victory declared for the Lacedaemonians and their allies. After
entering the Megarid and cutting down the fruit trees, the
Lacedaemonians returned home across Geraneia and the isthmus. Sixty-two
days after the battle the Athenians marched into Boeotia under the
command of Myronides, defeated the Boeotians in battle at Oenophyta,
and became masters of Boeotia and Phocis. They dismantled the walls of
the Tanagraeans, took a hundred of the richest men of the Opuntian
Locrians as hostages, and finished their own long walls. This was
followed by the surrender of the Aeginetans to Athens on conditions;
they pulled down their walls, gave up their ships, and agreed to pay
tribute in future. The Athenians sailed round Peloponnese under
Tolmides, son of Tolmaeus, burnt the arsenal of Lacedaemon, took
Chalcis, a town of the Corinthians, and in a descent upon Sicyon
defeated the Sicyonians in battle.

Meanwhile the Athenians in Egypt and their allies were still there, and
encountered all the vicissitudes of war. First the Athenians were
masters of Egypt, and the King sent Megabazus a Persian to Lacedaemon
with money to bribe the Peloponnesians to invade Attica and so draw off
the Athenians from Egypt. Finding that the matter made no progress, and
that the money was only being wasted, he recalled Megabazus with the
remainder of the money, and sent Megabuzus, son of Zopyrus, a Persian,
with a large army to Egypt. Arriving by land he defeated the Egyptians
and their allies in a battle, and drove the Hellenes out of Memphis,
and at length shut them up in the island of Prosopitis, where he
besieged them for a year and six months. At last, draining the canal of
its waters, which he diverted into another channel, he left their ships
high and dry and joined most of the island to the mainland, and then
marched over on foot and captured it. Thus the enterprise of the
Hellenes came to ruin after six years of war. Of all that large host a
few travelling through Libya reached Cyrene in safety, but most of them
perished. And thus Egypt returned to its subjection to the King, except
Amyrtaeus, the king in the marshes, whom they were unable to capture
from the extent of the marsh; the marshmen being also the most warlike
of the Egyptians. Inaros, the Libyan king, the sole author of the
Egyptian revolt, was betrayed, taken, and crucified. Meanwhile a
relieving squadron of fifty vessels had sailed from Athens and the rest
of the confederacy for Egypt. They put in to shore at the Mendesian
mouth of the Nile, in total ignorance of what had occurred. Attacked on
the land side by the troops, and from the sea by the Phoenician navy,
most of the ships were destroyed; the few remaining being saved by
retreat. Such was the end of the great expedition of the Athenians and
their allies to Egypt.

Meanwhile Orestes, son of Echecratidas, the Thessalian king, being an
exile from Thessaly, persuaded the Athenians to restore him. Taking
with them the Boeotians and Phocians their allies, the Athenians
marched to Pharsalus in Thessaly. They became masters of the country,
though only in the immediate vicinity of the camp; beyond which they
could not go for fear of the Thessalian cavalry. But they failed to
take the city or to attain any of the other objects of their
expedition, and returned home with Orestes without having effected
anything. Not long after this a thousand of the Athenians embarked in
the vessels that were at Pegae (Pegae, it must be remembered, was now
theirs), and sailed along the coast to Sicyon under the command of
Pericles, son of Xanthippus. Landing in Sicyon and defeating the
Sicyonians who engaged them, they immediately took with them the
Achaeans and, sailing across, marched against and laid siege to
Oeniadae in Acarnania. Failing however to take it, they returned home.

Three years afterwards a truce was made between the Peloponnesians and
Athenians for five years. Released from Hellenic war, the Athenians
made an expedition to Cyprus with two hundred vessels of their own and
their allies, under the command of Cimon. Sixty of these were detached
to Egypt at the instance of Amyrtaeus, the king in the marshes; the
rest laid siege to Kitium, from which, however, they were compelled to
retire by the death of Cimon and by scarcity of provisions. Sailing off
Salamis in Cyprus, they fought with the Phoenicians, Cyprians, and
Cilicians by land and sea, and, being victorious on both elements
departed home, and with them the returned squadron from Egypt. After
this the Lacedaemonians marched out on a sacred war, and, becoming
masters of the temple at Delphi, it in the hands of the Delphians.
Immediately after their retreat, the Athenians marched out, became
masters of the temple, and placed it in the hands of the Phocians.

Some time after this, Orchomenus, Chaeronea, and some other places in
Boeotia being in the hands of the Boeotian exiles, the Athenians
marched against the above-mentioned hostile places with a thousand
Athenian heavy infantry and the allied contingents, under the command
of Tolmides, son of Tolmaeus. They took Chaeronea, and made slaves of
the inhabitants, and, leaving a garrison, commenced their return. On
their road they were attacked at Coronea by the Boeotian exiles from
Orchomenus, with some Locrians and Euboean exiles, and others who were
of the same way of thinking, were defeated in battle, and some killed,
others taken captive. The Athenians evacuated all Boeotia by a treaty
providing for the recovery of the men; and the exiled Boeotians
returned, and with all the rest regained their independence.

This was soon afterwards followed by the revolt of Euboea from Athens.
Pericles had already crossed over with an army of Athenians to the
island, when news was brought to him that Megara had revolted, that the
Peloponnesians were on the point of invading Attica, and that the
Athenian garrison had been cut off by the Megarians, with the exception
of a few who had taken refuge in Nisaea. The Megarians had introduced
the Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Epidaurians into the town before they
revolted. Meanwhile Pericles brought his army back in all haste from
Euboea. After this the Peloponnesians marched into Attica as far as
Eleusis and Thrius, ravaging the country under the conduct of King
Pleistoanax, the son of Pausanias, and without advancing further
returned home. The Athenians then crossed over again to Euboea under
the command of Pericles, and subdued the whole of the island: all but
Histiaea was settled by convention; the Histiaeans they expelled from
their homes, and occupied their territory themselves.

Not long after their return from Euboea, they made a truce with the
Lacedaemonians and their allies for thirty years, giving up the posts
which they occupied in Peloponnese—Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia.
In the sixth year of the truce, war broke out between the Samians and
Milesians about Priene. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to
Athens with loud complaints against the Samians. In this they were
joined by certain private persons from Samos itself, who wished to
revolutionize the government. Accordingly the Athenians sailed to Samos
with forty ships and set up a democracy; took hostages from the
Samians, fifty boys and as many men, lodged them in Lemnos, and after
leaving a garrison in the island returned home. But some of the Samians
had not remained in the island, but had fled to the continent. Making
an agreement with the most powerful of those in the city, and an
alliance with Pissuthnes, son of Hystaspes, the then satrap of Sardis,
they got together a force of seven hundred mercenaries, and under cover
of night crossed over to Samos. Their first step was to rise on the
commons, most of whom they secured; their next to steal their hostages
from Lemnos; after which they revolted, gave up the Athenian garrison
left with them and its commanders to Pissuthnes, and instantly prepared
for an expedition against Miletus. The Byzantines also revolted with
them.

As soon as the Athenians heard the news, they sailed with sixty ships
against Samos. Sixteen of these went to Caria to look out for the
Phoenician fleet, and to Chios and Lesbos carrying round orders for
reinforcements, and so never engaged; but forty-four ships under the
command of Pericles with nine colleagues gave battle, off the island of
Tragia, to seventy Samian vessels, of which twenty were transports, as
they were sailing from Miletus. Victory remained with the Athenians.
Reinforced afterwards by forty ships from Athens, and twenty-five Chian
and Lesbian vessels, the Athenians landed, and having the superiority
by land invested the city with three walls; it was also invested from
the sea. Meanwhile Pericles took sixty ships from the blockading
squadron, and departed in haste for Caunus and Caria, intelligence
having been brought in of the approach of the Phoenician fleet to the
aid of the Samians; indeed Stesagoras and others had left the island
with five ships to bring them. But in the meantime the Samians made a
sudden sally, and fell on the camp, which they found unfortified.
Destroying the look-out vessels, and engaging and defeating such as
were being launched to meet them, they remained masters of their own
seas for fourteen days, and carried in and carried out what they
pleased. But on the arrival of Pericles, they were once more shut up.
Fresh reinforcements afterwards arrived—forty ships from Athens with
Thucydides, Hagnon, and Phormio; twenty with Tlepolemus and Anticles,
and thirty vessels from Chios and Lesbos. After a brief attempt at
fighting, the Samians, unable to hold out, were reduced after a nine
months’ siege and surrendered on conditions; they razed their walls,
gave hostages, delivered up their ships, and arranged to pay the
expenses of the war by instalments. The Byzantines also agreed to be
subject as before.




CHAPTER V


Second Congress at Lacedaemon—Preparations for War and Diplomatic
Skirmishes—Cylon—Pausanias—Themistocles


After this, though not many years later, we at length come to what has
been already related, the affairs of Corcyra and Potidæa, and the
events that served as a pretext for the present war. All these actions
of the Hellenes against each other and the barbarian occurred in the
fifty years’ interval between the retreat of Xerxes and the beginning
of the present war. During this interval the Athenians succeeded in
placing their empire on a firmer basis, and advanced their own home
power to a very great height. The Lacedaemonians, though fully aware of
it, opposed it only for a little while, but remained inactive during
most of the period, being of old slow to go to war except under the
pressure of necessity, and in the present instance being hampered by
wars at home; until the growth of the Athenian power could be no longer
ignored, and their own confederacy became the object of its
encroachments. They then felt that they could endure it no longer, but
that the time had come for them to throw themselves heart and soul upon
the hostile power, and break it, if they could, by commencing the
present war. And though the Lacedaemonians had made up their own minds
on the fact of the breach of the treaty and the guilt of the Athenians,
yet they sent to Delphi and inquired of the God whether it would be
well with them if they went to war; and, as it is reported, received
from him the answer that if they put their whole strength into the war,
victory would be theirs, and the promise that he himself would be with
them, whether invoked or uninvoked. Still they wished to summon their
allies again, and to take their vote on the propriety of making war.
After the ambassadors from the confederates had arrived and a congress
had been convened, they all spoke their minds, most of them denouncing
the Athenians and demanding that the war should begin. In particular
the Corinthians. They had before on their own account canvassed the
cities in detail to induce them to vote for the war, in the fear that
it might come too late to save Potidæa; they were present also on this
occasion, and came forward the last, and made the following speech:

“Fellow allies, we can no longer accuse the Lacedaemonians of having
failed in their duty: they have not only voted for war themselves, but
have assembled us here for that purpose. We say their duty, for
supremacy has its duties. Besides equitably administering private
interests, leaders are required to show a special care for the common
welfare in return for the special honours accorded to them by all in
other ways. For ourselves, all who have already had dealings with the
Athenians require no warning to be on their guard against them. The
states more inland and out of the highway of communication should
understand that, if they omit to support the coast powers, the result
will be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the
reception in exchange of their imports from the sea; and they must not
be careless judges of what is now said, as if it had nothing to do with
them, but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast
will one day be followed by the extension of the danger to the
interior, and must recognize that their own interests are deeply
involved in this discussion. For these reasons they should not hesitate
to exchange peace for war. If wise men remain quiet, while they are not
injured, brave men abandon peace for war when they are injured,
returning to an understanding on a favourable opportunity: in fact,
they are neither intoxicated by their success in war, nor disposed to
take an injury for the sake of the delightful tranquillity of peace.
Indeed, to falter for the sake of such delights is, if you remain
inactive, the quickest way of losing the sweets of repose to which you
cling; while to conceive extravagant pretensions from success in war is
to forget how hollow is the confidence by which you are elated. For if
many ill-conceived plans have succeeded through the still greater
fatuity of an opponent, many more, apparently well laid, have on the
contrary ended in disgrace. The confidence with which we form our
schemes is never completely justified in their execution; speculation
is carried on in safety, but, when it comes to action, fear causes
failure.

“To apply these rules to ourselves, if we are now kindling war it is
under the pressure of injury, with adequate grounds of complaint; and
after we have chastised the Athenians we will in season desist. We have
many reasons to expect success—first, superiority in numbers and in
military experience, and secondly our general and unvarying obedience
in the execution of orders. The naval strength which they possess shall
be raised by us from our respective antecedent resources, and from the
moneys at Olympia and Delphi. A loan from these enables us to seduce
their foreign sailors by the offer of higher pay. For the power of
Athens is more mercenary than national; while ours will not be exposed
to the same risk, as its strength lies more in men than in money. A
single defeat at sea is in all likelihood their ruin: should they hold
out, in that case there will be the more time for us to exercise
ourselves in naval matters; and as soon as we have arrived at an
equality in science, we need scarcely ask whether we shall be their
superiors in courage. For the advantages that we have by nature they
cannot acquire by education; while their superiority in science must be
removed by our practice. The money required for these objects shall be
provided by our contributions: nothing indeed could be more monstrous
than the suggestion that, while their allies never tire of contributing
for their own servitude, we should refuse to spend for vengeance and
self-preservation the treasure which by such refusal we shall forfeit
to Athenian rapacity and see employed for our own ruin.

“We have also other ways of carrying on the war, such as revolt of
their allies, the surest method of depriving them of their revenues,
which are the source of their strength, and establishment of fortified
positions in their country, and various operations which cannot be
foreseen at present. For war of all things proceeds least upon definite
rules, but draws principally upon itself for contrivances to meet an
emergency; and in such cases the party who faces the struggle and keeps
his temper best meets with most security, and he who loses his temper
about it with correspondent disaster. Let us also reflect that if it
was merely a number of disputes of territory between rival neighbours,
it might be borne; but here we have an enemy in Athens that is a match
for our whole coalition, and more than a match for any of its members;
so that unless as a body and as individual nationalities and individual
cities we make an unanimous stand against her, she will easily conquer
us divided and in detail. That conquest, terrible as it may sound,
would, it must be known, have no other end than slavery pure and
simple; a word which Peloponnese cannot even hear whispered without
disgrace, or without disgrace see so many states abused by one.
Meanwhile the opinion would be either that we were justly so used, or
that we put up with it from cowardice, and were proving degenerate sons
in not even securing for ourselves the freedom which our fathers gave
to Hellas; and in allowing the establishment in Hellas of a tyrant
state, though in individual states we think it our duty to put down
sole rulers. And we do not know how this conduct can be held free from
three of the gravest failings, want of sense, of courage, or of
vigilance. For we do not suppose that you have taken refuge in that
contempt of an enemy which has proved so fatal in so many instances—a
feeling which from the numbers that it has ruined has come to be called
not contemptuous but contemptible.

“There is, however, no advantage in reflections on the past further
than may be of service to the present. For the future we must provide
by maintaining what the present gives us and redoubling our efforts; it
is hereditary to us to win virtue as the fruit of labour, and you must
not change the habit, even though you should have a slight advantage in
wealth and resources; for it is not right that what was won in want
should be lost in plenty; no, we must boldly advance to the war for
many reasons; the god has commanded it and promised to be with us, and
the rest of Hellas will all join in the struggle, part from fear, part
from interest. You will be the first to break a treaty which the god,
in advising us to go to war, judges to be violated already, but rather
to support a treaty that has been outraged: indeed, treaties are broken
not by resistance but by aggression.

“Your position, therefore, from whatever quarter you may view it, will
amply justify you in going to war; and this step we recommend in the
interests of all, bearing in mind that identity of interest is the
surest of bonds, whether between states or individuals. Delay not,
therefore, to assist Potidæa, a Dorian city besieged by Ionians, which
is quite a reversal of the order of things; nor to assert the freedom
of the rest. It is impossible for us to wait any longer when waiting
can only mean immediate disaster for some of us, and, if it comes to be
known that we have conferred but do not venture to protect ourselves,
like disaster in the near future for the rest. Delay not, fellow
allies, but, convinced of the necessity of the crisis and the wisdom of
this counsel, vote for the war, undeterred by its immediate terrors,
but looking beyond to the lasting peace by which it will be succeeded.
Out of war peace gains fresh stability, but to refuse to abandon repose
for war is not so sure a method of avoiding danger. We must believe
that the tyrant city that has been established in Hellas has been
established against all alike, with a programme of universal empire,
part fulfilled, part in contemplation; let us then attack and reduce
it, and win future security for ourselves and freedom for the Hellenes
who are now enslaved.”

Such were the words of the Corinthians. The Lacedaemonians, having now
heard all, give their opinion, took the vote of all the allied states
present in order, great and small alike; and the majority voted for
war. This decided, it was still impossible for them to commence at
once, from their want of preparation; but it was resolved that the
means requisite were to be procured by the different states, and that
there was to be no delay. And indeed, in spite of the time occupied
with the necessary arrangements, less than a year elapsed before Attica
was invaded, and the war openly begun.

This interval was spent in sending embassies to Athens charged with
complaints, in order to obtain as good a pretext for war as possible,
in the event of her paying no attention to them. The first
Lacedaemonian embassy was to order the Athenians to drive out the curse
of the goddess; the history of which is as follows. In former
generations there was an Athenian of the name of Cylon, a victor at the
Olympic games, of good birth and powerful position, who had married a
daughter of Theagenes, a Megarian, at that time tyrant of Megara. Now
this Cylon was inquiring at Delphi; when he was told by the god to
seize the Acropolis of Athens on the grand festival of Zeus.
Accordingly, procuring a force from Theagenes and persuading his
friends to join him, when the Olympic festival in Peloponnese came, he
seized the Acropolis, with the intention of making himself tyrant,
thinking that this was the grand festival of Zeus, and also an occasion
appropriate for a victor at the Olympic games. Whether the grand
festival that was meant was in Attica or elsewhere was a question which
he never thought of, and which the oracle did not offer to solve. For
the Athenians also have a festival which is called the grand festival
of Zeus Meilichios or Gracious, viz., the Diasia. It is celebrated
outside the city, and the whole people sacrifice not real victims but a
number of bloodless offerings peculiar to the country. However,
fancying he had chosen the right time, he made the attempt. As soon as
the Athenians perceived it, they flocked in, one and all, from the
country, and sat down, and laid siege to the citadel. But as time went
on, weary of the labour of blockade, most of them departed; the
responsibility of keeping guard being left to the nine archons, with
plenary powers to arrange everything according to their good judgment.
It must be known that at that time most political functions were
discharged by the nine archons. Meanwhile Cylon and his besieged
companions were distressed for want of food and water. Accordingly
Cylon and his brother made their escape; but the rest being hard
pressed, and some even dying of famine, seated themselves as suppliants
at the altar in the Acropolis. The Athenians who were charged with the
duty of keeping guard, when they saw them at the point of death in the
temple, raised them up on the understanding that no harm should be done
to them, led them out, and slew them. Some who as they passed by took
refuge at the altars of the awful goddesses were dispatched on the
spot. From this deed the men who killed them were called accursed and
guilty against the goddess, they and their descendants. Accordingly
these cursed ones were driven out by the Athenians, driven out again by
Cleomenes of Lacedaemon and an Athenian faction; the living were driven
out, and the bones of the dead were taken up; thus they were cast out.
For all that, they came back afterwards, and their descendants are
still in the city.

This, then was the curse that the Lacedaemonians ordered them to drive
out. They were actuated primarily, as they pretended, by a care for the
honour of the gods; but they also know that Pericles, son of
Xanthippus, was connected with the curse on his mother’s side, and they
thought that his banishment would materially advance their designs on
Athens. Not that they really hoped to succeed in procuring this; they
rather thought to create a prejudice against him in the eyes of his
countrymen from the feeling that the war would be partly caused by his
misfortune. For being the most powerful man of his time, and the
leading Athenian statesman, he opposed the Lacedaemonians in
everything, and would have no concessions, but ever urged the Athenians
on to war.

The Athenians retorted by ordering the Lacedaemonians to drive out the
curse of Taenarus. The Lacedaemonians had once raised up some Helot
suppliants from the temple of Poseidon at Taenarus, led them away and
slain them; for which they believe the great earthquake at Sparta to
have been a retribution. The Athenians also ordered them to drive out
the curse of the goddess of the Brazen House; the history of which is
as follows. After Pausanias the Lacedaemonian had been recalled by the
Spartans from his command in the Hellespont (this is his first recall),
and had been tried by them and acquitted, not being again sent out in a
public capacity, he took a galley of Hermione on his own
responsibility, without the authority of the Lacedaemonians, and
arrived as a private person in the Hellespont. He came ostensibly for
the Hellenic war, really to carry on his intrigues with the King, which
he had begun before his recall, being ambitious of reigning over
Hellas. The circumstance which first enabled him to lay the King under
an obligation, and to make a beginning of the whole design, was this.
Some connections and kinsmen of the King had been taken in Byzantium,
on its capture from the Medes, when he was first there, after the
return from Cyprus. These captives he sent off to the King without the
knowledge of the rest of the allies, the account being that they had
escaped from him. He managed this with the help of Gongylus, an
Eretrian, whom he had placed in charge of Byzantium and the prisoners.
He also gave Gongylus a letter for the King, the contents of which were
as follows, as was afterwards discovered: “Pausanias, the general of
Sparta, anxious to do you a favour, sends you these his prisoners of
war. I propose also, with your approval, to marry your daughter, and to
make Sparta and the rest of Hellas subject to you. I may say that I
think I am able to do this, with your co-operation. Accordingly if any
of this please you, send a safe man to the sea through whom we may in
future conduct our correspondence.”

This was all that was revealed in the writing, and Xerxes was pleased
with the letter. He sent off Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, to the sea
with orders to supersede Megabates, the previous governor in the
satrapy of Daskylion, and to send over as quickly as possible to
Pausanias at Byzantium a letter which he entrusted to him; to show him
the royal signet, and to execute any commission which he might receive
from Pausanias on the King’s matters with all care and fidelity.
Artabazus on his arrival carried the King’s orders into effect, and
sent over the letter, which contained the following answer: “Thus saith
King Xerxes to Pausanias. For the men whom you have saved for me across
sea from Byzantium, an obligation is laid up for you in our house,
recorded for ever; and with your proposals I am well pleased. Let
neither night nor day stop you from diligently performing any of your
promises to me; neither for cost of gold nor of silver let them be
hindered, nor yet for number of troops, wherever it may be that their
presence is needed; but with Artabazus, an honourable man whom I send
you, boldly advance my objects and yours, as may be most for the honour
and interest of us both.”

Before held in high honour by the Hellenes as the hero of Plataea,
Pausanias, after the receipt of this letter, became prouder than ever,
and could no longer live in the usual style, but went out of Byzantium
in a Median dress, was attended on his march through Thrace by a
bodyguard of Medes and Egyptians, kept a Persian table, and was quite
unable to contain his intentions, but betrayed by his conduct in
trifles what his ambition looked one day to enact on a grander scale.
He also made himself difficult of access, and displayed so violent a
temper to every one without exception that no one could come near him.
Indeed, this was the principal reason why the confederacy went over to
the Athenians.

The above-mentioned conduct, coming to the ears of the Lacedaemonians,
occasioned his first recall. And after his second voyage out in the
ship of Hermione, without their orders, he gave proofs of similar
behaviour. Besieged and expelled from Byzantium by the Athenians, he
did not return to Sparta; but news came that he had settled at Colonae
in the Troad, and was intriguing with the barbarians, and that his stay
there was for no good purpose; and the ephors, now no longer
hesitating, sent him a herald and a scytale with orders to accompany
the herald or be declared a public enemy. Anxious above everything to
avoid suspicion, and confident that he could quash the charge by means
of money, he returned a second time to Sparta. At first thrown into
prison by the ephors (whose powers enable them to do this to the King),
soon compromised the matter and came out again, and offered himself for
trial to any who wished to institute an inquiry concerning him.

Now the Spartans had no tangible proof against him—neither his enemies
nor the nation—of that indubitable kind required for the punishment of
a member of the royal family, and at that moment in high office; he
being regent for his first cousin King Pleistarchus, Leonidas’s son,
who was still a minor. But by his contempt of the laws and imitation of
the barbarians, he gave grounds for much suspicion of his being
discontented with things established; all the occasions on which he had
in any way departed from the regular customs were passed in review, and
it was remembered that he had taken upon himself to have inscribed on
the tripod at Delphi, which was dedicated by the Hellenes as the
first-fruits of the spoil of the Medes, the following couplet:

The Mede defeated, great Pausanias raised
This monument, that Phœbus might be praised.


At the time the Lacedaemonians had at once erased the couplet, and
inscribed the names of the cities that had aided in the overthrow of
the barbarian and dedicated the offering. Yet it was considered that
Pausanias had here been guilty of a grave offence, which, interpreted
by the light of the attitude which he had since assumed, gained a new
significance, and seemed to be quite in keeping with his present
schemes. Besides, they were informed that he was even intriguing with
the Helots; and such indeed was the fact, for he promised them freedom
and citizenship if they would join him in insurrection and would help
him to carry out his plans to the end. Even now, mistrusting the
evidence even of the Helots themselves, the ephors would not consent to
take any decided step against him; in accordance with their regular
custom towards themselves, namely, to be slow in taking any irrevocable
resolve in the matter of a Spartan citizen without indisputable proof.
At last, it is said, the person who was going to carry to Artabazus the
last letter for the King, a man of Argilus, once the favourite and most
trusty servant of Pausanias, turned informer. Alarmed by the reflection
that none of the previous messengers had ever returned, having
counterfeited the seal, in order that, if he found himself mistaken in
his surmises, or if Pausanias should ask to make some correction, he
might not be discovered, he undid the letter, and found the postscript
that he had suspected, viz. an order to put him to death.

On being shown the letter, the ephors now felt more certain. Still,
they wished to hear Pausanias commit himself with their own ears.
Accordingly the man went by appointment to Taenarus as a suppliant, and
there built himself a hut divided into two by a partition; within which
he concealed some of the ephors and let them hear the whole matter
plainly. For Pausanias came to him and asked him the reason of his
suppliant position; and the man reproached him with the order that he
had written concerning him, and one by one declared all the rest of the
circumstances, how he who had never yet brought him into any danger,
while employed as agent between him and the King, was yet just like the
mass of his servants to be rewarded with death. Admitting all this, and
telling him not to be angry about the matter, Pausanias gave him the
pledge of raising him up from the temple, and begged him to set off as
quickly as possible, and not to hinder the business in hand.

The ephors listened carefully, and then departed, taking no action for
the moment, but, having at last attained to certainty, were preparing
to arrest him in the city. It is reported that, as he was about to be
arrested in the street, he saw from the face of one of the ephors what
he was coming for; another, too, made him a secret signal, and betrayed
it to him from kindness. Setting off with a run for the temple of the
goddess of the Brazen House, the enclosure of which was near at hand,
he succeeded in taking sanctuary before they took him, and entering
into a small chamber, which formed part of the temple, to avoid being
exposed to the weather, lay still there. The ephors, for the moment
distanced in the pursuit, afterwards took off the roof of the chamber,
and having made sure that he was inside, shut him in, barricaded the
doors, and staying before the place, reduced him by starvation. When
they found that he was on the point of expiring, just as he was, in the
chamber, they brought him out of the temple, while the breath was still
in him, and as soon as he was brought out he died. They were going to
throw him into the Kaiadas, where they cast criminals, but finally
decided to inter him somewhere near. But the god at Delphi afterwards
ordered the Lacedaemonians to remove the tomb to the place of his
death—where he now lies in the consecrated ground, as an inscription on
a monument declares—and, as what had been done was a curse to them, to
give back two bodies instead of one to the goddess of the Brazen House.
So they had two brazen statues made, and dedicated them as a substitute
for Pausanias. The Athenians retorted by telling the Lacedaemonians to
drive out what the god himself had pronounced to be a curse.

To return to the Medism of Pausanias. Matter was found in the course of
the inquiry to implicate Themistocles; and the Lacedaemonians
accordingly sent envoys to the Athenians and required them to punish
him as they had punished Pausanias. The Athenians consented to do so.
But he had, as it happened, been ostracized, and, with a residence at
Argos, was in the habit of visiting other parts of Peloponnese. So they
sent with the Lacedaemonians, who were ready to join in the pursuit,
persons with instructions to take him wherever they found him. But
Themistocles got scent of their intentions, and fled from Peloponnese
to Corcyra, which was under obligations towards him. But the
Corcyraeans alleged that they could not venture to shelter him at the
cost of offending Athens and Lacedaemon, and they conveyed him over to
the continent opposite. Pursued by the officers who hung on the report
of his movements, at a loss where to turn, he was compelled to stop at
the house of Admetus, the Molossian king, though they were not on
friendly terms. Admetus happened not to be indoors, but his wife, to
whom he made himself a suppliant, instructed him to take their child in
his arms and sit down by the hearth. Soon afterwards Admetus came in,
and Themistocles told him who he was, and begged him not to revenge on
Themistocles in exile any opposition which his requests might have
experienced from Themistocles at Athens. Indeed, he was now far too low
for his revenge; retaliation was only honourable between equals.
Besides, his opposition to the king had only affected the success of a
request, not the safety of his person; if the king were to give him up
to the pursuers that he mentioned, and the fate which they intended for
him, he would just be consigning him to certain death.

The King listened to him and raised him up with his son, as he was
sitting with him in his arms after the most effectual method of
supplication, and on the arrival of the Lacedaemonians not long
afterwards, refused to give him up for anything they could say, but
sent him off by land to the other sea to Pydna in Alexander’s
dominions, as he wished to go to the Persian king. There he met with a
merchantman on the point of starting for Ionia. Going on board, he was
carried by a storm to the Athenian squadron which was blockading Naxos.
In his alarm—he was luckily unknown to the people in the vessel—he told
the master who he was and what he was flying for, and said that, if he
refused to save him, he would declare that he was taking him for a
bribe. Meanwhile their safety consisted in letting no one leave the
ship until a favourable time for sailing should arise. If he complied
with his wishes, he promised him a proper recompense. The master acted
as he desired, and, after lying to for a day and a night out of reach
of the squadron, at length arrived at Ephesus.

After having rewarded him with a present of money, as soon as he
received some from his friends at Athens and from his secret hoards at
Argos, Themistocles started inland with one of the coast Persians, and
sent a letter to King Artaxerxes, Xerxes’s son, who had just come to
the throne. Its contents were as follows: “I, Themistocles, am come to
you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was
compelled to defend myself against your father’s invasion—harm,
however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat,
which brought no danger for me but much for him. For the past, you are
a good turn in my debt”—here he mentioned the warning sent to Xerxes
from Salamis to retreat, as well as his finding the bridges unbroken,
which, as he falsely pretended, was due to him—“for the present, able
to do you great service, I am here, pursued by the Hellenes for my
friendship for you. However, I desire a year’s grace, when I shall be
able to declare in person the objects of my coming.”

It is said that the King approved his intention, and told him to do as
he said. He employed the interval in making what progress he could in
the study of the Persian tongue, and of the customs of the country.
Arrived at court at the end of the year, he attained to very high
consideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or
since; partly from his splendid antecedents, partly from the hopes
which he held out of effecting for him the subjugation of Hellas, but
principally by the proof which experience daily gave of his capacity.
For Themistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of
genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration
quite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own native capacity, alike
unformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in
those sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and
the best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities.
An able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his
practice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment
in matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently
divine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine,
whether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness
of his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have
surpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an
emergency. Disease was the real cause of his death; though there is a
story of his having ended his life by poison, on finding himself unable
to fulfil his promises to the king. However this may be, there is a
monument to him in the marketplace of Asiatic Magnesia. He was governor
of the district, the King having given him Magnesia, which brought in
fifty talents a year, for bread, Lampsacus, which was considered to be
the richest wine country, for wine, and Myos for other provisions. His
bones, it is said, were conveyed home by his relatives in accordance
with his wishes, and interred in Attic ground. This was done without
the knowledge of the Athenians; as it is against the law to bury in
Attica an outlaw for treason. So ends the history of Pausanias and
Themistocles, the Lacedaemonian and the Athenian, the most famous men
of their time in Hellas.

To return to the Lacedaemonians. The history of their first embassy,
the injunctions which it conveyed, and the rejoinder which it provoked,
concerning the expulsion of the accursed persons, have been related
already. It was followed by a second, which ordered Athens to raise the
siege of Potidæa, and to respect the independence of Aegina. Above all,
it gave her most distinctly to understand that war might be prevented
by the revocation of the Megara decree, excluding the Megarians from
the use of Athenian harbours and of the market of Athens. But Athens
was not inclined either to revoke the decree, or to entertain their
other proposals; she accused the Megarians of pushing their cultivation
into the consecrated ground and the unenclosed land on the border, and
of harbouring her runaway slaves. At last an embassy arrived with the
Lacedaemonian ultimatum. The ambassadors were Ramphias, Melesippus, and
Agesander. Not a word was said on any of the old subjects; there was
simply this: “Lacedaemon wishes the peace to continue, and there is no
reason why it should not, if you would leave the Hellenes independent.”
Upon this the Athenians held an assembly, and laid the matter before
their consideration. It was resolved to deliberate once for all on all
their demands, and to give them an answer. There were many speakers who
came forward and gave their support to one side or the other, urging
the necessity of war, or the revocation of the decree and the folly of
allowing it to stand in the way of peace. Among them came forward
Pericles, son of Xanthippus, the first man of his time at Athens,
ablest alike in counsel and in action, and gave the following advice:

“There is one principle, Athenians, which I hold to through everything,
and that is the principle of no concession to the Peloponnesians. I
know that the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded
to make war is not always retained in action; that as circumstances
change, resolutions change. Yet I see that now as before the same,
almost literally the same, counsel is demanded of me; and I put it to
those of you who are allowing yourselves to be persuaded, to support
the national resolves even in the case of reverses, or to forfeit all
credit for their wisdom in the event of success. For sometimes the
course of things is as arbitrary as the plans of man; indeed this is
why we usually blame chance for whatever does not happen as we
expected. Now it was clear before that Lacedaemon entertained designs
against us; it is still more clear now. The treaty provides that we
shall mutually submit our differences to legal settlement, and that we
shall meanwhile each keep what we have. Yet the Lacedaemonians never
yet made us any such offer, never yet would accept from us any such
offer; on the contrary, they wish complaints to be settled by war
instead of by negotiation; and in the end we find them here dropping
the tone of expostulation and adopting that of command. They order us
to raise the siege of Potidæa, to let Aegina be independent, to revoke
the Megara decree; and they conclude with an ultimatum warning us to
leave the Hellenes independent. I hope that you will none of you think
that we shall be going to war for a trifle if we refuse to revoke the
Megara decree, which appears in front of their complaints, and the
revocation of which is to save us from war, or let any feeling of
self-reproach linger in your minds, as if you went to war for slight
cause. Why, this trifle contains the whole seal and trial of your
resolution. If you give way, you will instantly have to meet some
greater demand, as having been frightened into obedience in the first
instance; while a firm refusal will make them clearly understand that
they must treat you more as equals. Make your decision therefore at
once, either to submit before you are harmed, or if we are to go to
war, as I for one think we ought, to do so without caring whether the
ostensible cause be great or small, resolved against making concessions
or consenting to a precarious tenure of our possessions. For all claims
from an equal, urged upon a neighbour as commands before any attempt at
legal settlement, be they great or be they small, have only one
meaning, and that is slavery.

“As to the war and the resources of either party, a detailed comparison
will not show you the inferiority of Athens. Personally engaged in the
cultivation of their land, without funds either private or public, the
Peloponnesians are also without experience in long wars across sea,
from the strict limit which poverty imposes on their attacks upon each
other. Powers of this description are quite incapable of often manning
a fleet or often sending out an army: they cannot afford the absence
from their homes, the expenditure from their own funds; and besides,
they have not command of the sea. Capital, it must be remembered,
maintains a war more than forced contributions. Farmers are a class of
men that are always more ready to serve in person than in purse.
Confident that the former will survive the dangers, they are by no
means so sure that the latter will not be prematurely exhausted,
especially if the war last longer than they expect, which it very
likely will. In a single battle the Peloponnesians and their allies may
be able to defy all Hellas, but they are incapacitated from carrying on
a war against a power different in character from their own, by the
want of the single council-chamber requisite to prompt and vigorous
action, and the substitution of a diet composed of various races, in
which every state possesses an equal vote, and each presses its own
ends, a condition of things which generally results in no action at
all. The great wish of some is to avenge themselves on some particular
enemy, the great wish of others to save their own pocket. Slow in
assembling, they devote a very small fraction of the time to the
consideration of any public object, most of it to the prosecution of
their own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his
neglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or
that for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all
separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays.

“But the principal point is the hindrance that they will experience
from want of money. The slowness with which it comes in will cause
delay; but the opportunities of war wait for no man. Again, we need not
be alarmed either at the possibility of their raising fortifications in
Attica, or at their navy. It would be difficult for any system of
fortifications to establish a rival city, even in time of peace, much
more, surely, in an enemy’s country, with Athens just as much fortified
against it as it against Athens; while a mere post might be able to do
some harm to the country by incursions and by the facilities which it
would afford for desertion, but can never prevent our sailing into
their country and raising fortifications there, and making reprisals
with our powerful fleet. For our naval skill is of more use to us for
service on land, than their military skill for service at sea.
Familiarity with the sea they will not find an easy acquisition. If you
who have been practising at it ever since the Median invasion have not
yet brought it to perfection, is there any chance of anything
considerable being effected by an agricultural, unseafaring population,
who will besides be prevented from practising by the constant presence
of strong squadrons of observation from Athens? With a small squadron
they might hazard an engagement, encouraging their ignorance by
numbers; but the restraint of a strong force will prevent their moving,
and through want of practice they will grow more clumsy, and
consequently more timid. It must be kept in mind that seamanship, just
like anything else, is a matter of art, and will not admit of being
taken up occasionally as an occupation for times of leisure; on the
contrary, it is so exacting as to leave leisure for nothing else.

“Even if they were to touch the moneys at Olympia or Delphi, and try to
seduce our foreign sailors by the temptation of higher pay, that would
only be a serious danger if we could not still be a match for them by
embarking our own citizens and the aliens resident among us. But in
fact by this means we are always a match for them; and, best of all, we
have a larger and higher class of native coxswains and sailors among
our own citizens than all the rest of Hellas. And to say nothing of the
danger of such a step, none of our foreign sailors would consent to
become an outlaw from his country, and to take service with them and
their hopes, for the sake of a few days’ high pay.

“This, I think, is a tolerably fair account of the position of the
Peloponnesians; that of Athens is free from the defects that I have
criticized in them, and has other advantages of its own, which they can
show nothing to equal. If they march against our country we will sail
against theirs, and it will then be found that the desolation of the
whole of Attica is not the same as that of even a fraction of
Peloponnese; for they will not be able to supply the deficiency except
by a battle, while we have plenty of land both on the islands and the
continent. The rule of the sea is indeed a great matter. Consider for a
moment. Suppose that we were islanders; can you conceive a more
impregnable position? Well, this in future should, as far as possible,
be our conception of our position. Dismissing all thought of our land
and houses, we must vigilantly guard the sea and the city. No
irritation that we may feel for the former must provoke us to a battle
with the numerical superiority of the Peloponnesians. A victory would
only be succeeded by another battle against the same superiority: a
reverse involves the loss of our allies, the source of our strength,
who will not remain quiet a day after we become unable to march against
them. We must cry not over the loss of houses and land but of men’s
lives; since houses and land do not gain men, but men them. And if I
had thought that I could persuade you, I would have bid you go out and
lay them waste with your own hands, and show the Peloponnesians that
this at any rate will not make you submit.

“I have many other reasons to hope for a favourable issue, if you can
consent not to combine schemes of fresh conquest with the conduct of
the war, and will abstain from wilfully involving yourselves in other
dangers; indeed, I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the
enemy’s devices. But these matters shall be explained in another
speech, as events require; for the present dismiss these men with the
answer that we will allow Megara the use of our market and harbours,
when the Lacedaemonians suspend their alien acts in favour of us and
our allies, there being nothing in the treaty to prevent either one or
the other: that we will leave the cities independent, if independent we
found them when we made the treaty, and when the Lacedaemonians grant
to their cities an independence not involving subservience to
Lacedaemonian interests, but such as each severally may desire: that we
are willing to give the legal satisfaction which our agreements
specify, and that we shall not commence hostilities, but shall resist
those who do commence them. This is an answer agreeable at once to the
rights and the dignity of Athens. It must be thoroughly understood that
war is a necessity; but that the more readily we accept it, the less
will be the ardour of our opponents, and that out of the greatest
dangers communities and individuals acquire the greatest glory. Did not
our fathers resist the Medes not only with resources far different from
ours, but even when those resources had been abandoned; and more by
wisdom than by fortune, more by daring than by strength, did not they
beat off the barbarian and advance their affairs to their present
height? We must not fall behind them, but must resist our enemies in
any way and in every way, and attempt to hand down our power to our
posterity unimpaired.”

Such were the words of Pericles. The Athenians, persuaded of the wisdom
of his advice, voted as he desired, and answered the Lacedaemonians as
he recommended, both on the separate points and in the general; they
would do nothing on dictation, but were ready to have the complaints
settled in a fair and impartial manner by the legal method, which the
terms of the truce prescribed. So the envoys departed home and did not
return again.

These were the charges and differences existing between the rival
powers before the war, arising immediately from the affair at Epidamnus
and Corcyra. Still intercourse continued in spite of them, and mutual
communication. It was carried on without heralds, but not without
suspicion, as events were occurring which were equivalent to a breach
of the treaty and matter for war.

CHAPTER VI


Beginning of the Peloponnesian War—First Invasion of Attica—Funeral
Oration of Pericles


The war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians and the allies on
either side now really begins. For now all intercourse except through
the medium of heralds ceased, and hostilities were commenced and
prosecuted without intermission. The history follows the chronological
order of events by summers and winters.

The thirty years’ truce which was entered into after the conquest of
Euboea lasted fourteen years. In the fifteenth, in the forty-eighth
year of the priestess-ship of Chrysis at Argos, in the ephorate of
Aenesias at Sparta, in the last month but two of the archonship of
Pythodorus at Athens, and six months after the battle of Potidæa, just
at the beginning of spring, a Theban force a little over three hundred
strong, under the command of their Boeotarchs, Pythangelus, son of
Phyleides, and Diemporus, son of Onetorides, about the first watch of
the night, made an armed entry into Plataea, a town of Boeotia in
alliance with Athens. The gates were opened to them by a Plataean
called Naucleides, who, with his party, had invited them in, meaning to
put to death the citizens of the opposite party, bring over the city to
Thebes, and thus obtain power for themselves. This was arranged through
Eurymachus, son of Leontiades, a person of great influence at Thebes.
For Plataea had always been at variance with Thebes; and the latter,
foreseeing that war was at hand, wished to surprise her old enemy in
time of peace, before hostilities had actually broken out. Indeed this
was how they got in so easily without being observed, as no guard had
been posted. After the soldiers had grounded arms in the market-place,
those who had invited them in wished them to set to work at once and go
to their enemies’ houses. This, however, the Thebans refused to do, but
determined to make a conciliatory proclamation, and if possible to come
to a friendly understanding with the citizens. Their herald accordingly
invited any who wished to resume their old place in the confederacy of
their countrymen to ground arms with them, for they thought that in
this way the city would readily join them.

On becoming aware of the presence of the Thebans within their gates,
and of the sudden occupation of the town, the Plataeans concluded in
their alarm that more had entered than was really the case, the night
preventing their seeing them. They accordingly came to terms and,
accepting the proposal, made no movement; especially as the Thebans
offered none of them any violence. But somehow or other, during the
negotiations, they discovered the scanty numbers of the Thebans, and
decided that they could easily attack and overpower them; the mass of
the Plataeans being averse to revolting from Athens. At all events they
resolved to attempt it. Digging through the party walls of the houses,
they thus managed to join each other without being seen going through
the streets, in which they placed wagons without the beasts in them, to
serve as a barricade, and arranged everything else as seemed convenient
for the occasion. When everything had been done that circumstances
permitted, they watched their opportunity and went out of their houses
against the enemy. It was still night, though daybreak was at hand: in
daylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of
courage and on equal terms with their assailants, while in darkness it
would fall upon panic-stricken troops, who would also be at a
disadvantage from their enemy’s knowledge of the locality. So they made
their assault at once, and came to close quarters as quickly as they
could.

The Thebans, finding themselves outwitted, immediately closed up to
repel all attacks made upon them. Twice or thrice they beat back their
assailants. But the men shouted and charged them, the women and slaves
screamed and yelled from the houses and pelted them with stones and
tiles; besides, it had been raining hard all night; and so at last
their courage gave way, and they turned and fled through the town. Most
of the fugitives were quite ignorant of the right ways out, and this,
with the mud, and the darkness caused by the moon being in her last
quarter, and the fact that their pursuers knew their way about and
could easily stop their escape, proved fatal to many. The only gate
open was the one by which they had entered, and this was shut by one of
the Plataeans driving the spike of a javelin into the bar instead of
the bolt; so that even here there was no longer any means of exit. They
were now chased all over the town. Some got on the wall and threw
themselves over, in most cases with a fatal result. One party managed
to find a deserted gate, and obtaining an axe from a woman, cut through
the bar; but as they were soon observed only a few succeeded in getting
out. Others were cut off in detail in different parts of the city. The
most numerous and compact body rushed into a large building next to the
city wall: the doors on the side of the street happened to be open, and
the Thebans fancied that they were the gates of the town, and that
there was a passage right through to the outside. The Plataeans, seeing
their enemies in a trap, now consulted whether they should set fire to
the building and burn them just as they were, or whether there was
anything else that they could do with them; until at length these and
the rest of the Theban survivors found wandering about the town agreed
to an unconditional surrender of themselves and their arms to the
Plataeans.

While such was the fate of the party in Plataea, the rest of the
Thebans who were to have joined them with all their forces before
daybreak, in case of anything miscarrying with the body that had
entered, received the news of the affair on the road, and pressed
forward to their succour. Now Plataea is nearly eight miles from
Thebes, and their march delayed by the rain that had fallen in the
night, for the river Asopus had risen and was not easy of passage; and
so, having to march in the rain, and being hindered in crossing the
river, they arrived too late, and found the whole party either slain or
captive. When they learned what had happened, they at once formed a
design against the Plataeans outside the city. As the attack had been
made in time of peace, and was perfectly unexpected, there were of
course men and stock in the fields; and the Thebans wished if possible
to have some prisoners to exchange against their countrymen in the
town, should any chance to have been taken alive. Such was their plan.
But the Plataeans suspected their intention almost before it was
formed, and becoming alarmed for their fellow citizens outside the
town, sent a herald to the Thebans, reproaching them for their
unscrupulous attempt to seize their city in time of peace, and warning
them against any outrage on those outside. Should the warning be
disregarded, they threatened to put to death the men they had in their
hands, but added that, on the Thebans retiring from their territory,
they would surrender the prisoners to their friends. This is the Theban
account of the matter, and they say that they had an oath given them.
The Plataeans, on the other hand, do not admit any promise of an
immediate surrender, but make it contingent upon subsequent
negotiation: the oath they deny altogether. Be this as it may, upon the
Thebans retiring from their territory without committing any injury,
the Plataeans hastily got in whatever they had in the country and
immediately put the men to death. The prisoners were a hundred and
eighty in number; Eurymachus, the person with whom the traitors had
negotiated, being one.

This done, the Plataeans sent a messenger to Athens, gave back the dead
to the Thebans under a truce, and arranged things in the city as seemed
best to meet the present emergency. The Athenians meanwhile, having had
word of the affair sent them immediately after its occurrence, had
instantly seized all the Boeotians in Attica, and sent a herald to the
Plataeans to forbid their proceeding to extremities with their Theban
prisoners without instructions from Athens. The news of the men’s death
had of course not arrived; the first messenger having left Plataea just
when the Thebans entered it, the second just after their defeat and
capture; so there was no later news. Thus the Athenians sent orders in
ignorance of the facts; and the herald on his arrival found the men
slain. After this the Athenians marched to Plataea and brought in
provisions, and left a garrison in the place, also taking away the
women and children and such of the men as were least efficient.

After the affair at Plataea, the treaty had been broken by an overt
act, and Athens at once prepared for war, as did also Lacedaemon and
her allies. They resolved to send embassies to the King and to such
other of the barbarian powers as either party could look to for
assistance, and tried to ally themselves with the independent states at
home. Lacedaemon, in addition to the existing marine, gave orders to
the states that had declared for her in Italy and Sicily to build
vessels up to a grand total of five hundred, the quota of each city
being determined by its size, and also to provide a specified sum of
money. Till these were ready they were to remain neutral and to admit
single Athenian ships into their harbours. Athens on her part reviewed
her existing confederacy, and sent embassies to the places more
immediately round Peloponnese—Corcyra, Cephallenia, Acarnania, and
Zacynthus—perceiving that if these could be relied on she could carry
the war all round Peloponnese.

And if both sides nourished the boldest hopes and put forth their
utmost strength for the war, this was only natural. Zeal is always at
its height at the commencement of an undertaking; and on this
particular occasion Peloponnese and Athens were both full of young men
whose inexperience made them eager to take up arms, while the rest of
Hellas stood straining with excitement at the conflict of its leading
cities. Everywhere predictions were being recited and oracles being
chanted by such persons as collect them, and this not only in the
contending cities. Further, some while before this, there was an
earthquake at Delos, for the first time in the memory of the Hellenes.
This was said and thought to be ominous of the events impending;
indeed, nothing of the kind that happened was allowed to pass without
remark. The good wishes of men made greatly for the Lacedaemonians,
especially as they proclaimed themselves the liberators of Hellas. No
private or public effort that could help them in speech or action was
omitted; each thinking that the cause suffered wherever he could not
himself see to it. So general was the indignation felt against Athens,
whether by those who wished to escape from her empire, or were
apprehensive of being absorbed by it. Such were the preparations and
such the feelings with which the contest opened.

The allies of the two belligerents were the following. These were the
allies of Lacedaemon: all the Peloponnesians within the Isthmus except
the Argives and Achaeans, who were neutral; Pellene being the only
Achaean city that first joined in the war, though her example was
afterwards followed by the rest. Outside Peloponnese the Megarians,
Locrians, Boeotians, Phocians, Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians.
Of these, ships were furnished by the Corinthians, Megarians,
Sicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, and Leucadians; and cavalry
by the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians. The other states sent
infantry. This was the Lacedaemonian confederacy. That of Athens
comprised the Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, the Messenians in Naupactus,
most of the Acarnanians, the Corcyraeans, Zacynthians, and some
tributary cities in the following countries, viz., Caria upon the sea
with her Dorian neighbours, Ionia, the Hellespont, the Thracian towns,
the islands lying between Peloponnese and Crete towards the east, and
all the Cyclades except Melos and Thera. Of these, ships were furnished
by Chios, Lesbos, and Corcyra, infantry and money by the rest. Such
were the allies of either party and their resources for the war.

Immediately after the affair at Plataea, Lacedaemon sent round orders
to the cities in Peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to prepare
troops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign, in order to
invade Attica. The several states were ready at the time appointed and
assembled at the Isthmus: the contingent of each city being two-thirds
of its whole force. After the whole army had mustered, the
Lacedaemonian king, Archidamus, the leader of the expedition, called
together the generals of all the states and the principal persons and
officers, and exhorted them as follows:

“Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers made many campaigns both within
and without Peloponnese, and the elder men among us here are not
without experience in war. Yet we have never set out with a larger
force than the present; and if our numbers and efficiency are
remarkable, so also is the power of the state against which we march.
We ought not then to show ourselves inferior to our ancestors, or
unequal to our own reputation. For the hopes and attention of all
Hellas are bent upon the present effort, and its sympathy is with the
enemy of the hated Athens. Therefore, numerous as the invading army may
appear to be, and certain as some may think it that our adversary will
not meet us in the field, this is no sort of justification for the
least negligence upon the march; but the officers and men of each
particular city should always be prepared for the advent of danger in
their own quarters. The course of war cannot be foreseen, and its
attacks are generally dictated by the impulse of the moment; and where
overweening self-confidence has despised preparation, a wise
apprehension often been able to make head against superior numbers. Not
that confidence is out of place in an army of invasion, but in an
enemy’s country it should also be accompanied by the precautions of
apprehension: troops will by this combination be best inspired for
dealing a blow, and best secured against receiving one. In the present
instance, the city against which we are going, far from being so
impotent for defence, is on the contrary most excellently equipped at
all points; so that we have every reason to expect that they will take
the field against us, and that if they have not set out already before
we are there, they will certainly do so when they see us in their
territory wasting and destroying their property. For men are always
exasperated at suffering injuries to which they are not accustomed, and
on seeing them inflicted before their very eyes; and where least
inclined for reflection, rush with the greatest heat to action. The
Athenians are the very people of all others to do this, as they aspire
to rule the rest of the world, and are more in the habit of invading
and ravaging their neighbours’ territory, than of seeing their own
treated in the like fashion. Considering, therefore, the power of the
state against which we are marching, and the greatness of the
reputation which, according to the event, we shall win or lose for our
ancestors and ourselves, remember as you follow where you may be led to
regard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance, and to obey
with alacrity the orders transmitted to you; as nothing contributes so
much to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies
by a single discipline.”

With this brief speech dismissing the assembly, Archidamus first sent
off Melesippus, son of Diacritus, a Spartan, to Athens, in case she
should be more inclined to submit on seeing the Peloponnesians actually
on the march. But the Athenians did not admit into the city or to their
assembly, Pericles having already carried a motion against admitting
either herald or embassy from the Lacedaemonians after they had once
marched out.

The herald was accordingly sent away without an audience, and ordered
to be beyond the frontier that same day; in future, if those who sent
him had a proposition to make, they must retire to their own territory
before they dispatched embassies to Athens. An escort was sent with
Melesippus to prevent his holding communication with any one. When he
reached the frontier and was just going to be dismissed, he departed
with these words: “This day will be the beginning of great misfortunes
to the Hellenes.” As soon as he arrived at the camp, and Archidamus
learnt that the Athenians had still no thoughts of submitting, he at
length began his march, and advanced with his army into their
territory. Meanwhile the Boeotians, sending their contingent and
cavalry to join the Peloponnesian expedition, went to Plataea with the
remainder and laid waste the country.

While the Peloponnesians were still mustering at the Isthmus, or on the
march before they invaded Attica, Pericles, son of Xanthippus, one of
the ten generals of the Athenians, finding that the invasion was to
take place, conceived the idea that Archidamus, who happened to be his
friend, might possibly pass by his estate without ravaging it. This he
might do, either from a personal wish to oblige him, or acting under
instructions from Lacedaemon for the purpose of creating a prejudice
against him, as had been before attempted in the demand for the
expulsion of the accursed family. He accordingly took the precaution of
announcing to the Athenians in the assembly that, although Archidamus
was his friend, yet this friendship should not extend to the detriment
of the state, and that in case the enemy should make his houses and
lands an exception to the rest and not pillage them, he at once gave
them up to be public property, so that they should not bring him into
suspicion. He also gave the citizens some advice on their present
affairs in the same strain as before. They were to prepare for the war,
and to carry in their property from the country. They were not to go
out to battle, but to come into the city and guard it, and get ready
their fleet, in which their real strength lay. They were also to keep a
tight rein on their allies—the strength of Athens being derived from
the money brought in by their payments, and success in war depending
principally upon conduct and capital, had no reason to despond. Apart
from other sources of income, an average revenue of six hundred talents
of silver was drawn from the tribute of the allies; and there were
still six thousand talents of coined silver in the Acropolis, out of
nine thousand seven hundred that had once been there, from which the
money had been taken for the porch of the Acropolis, the other public
buildings, and for Potidæa. This did not include the uncoined gold and
silver in public and private offerings, the sacred vessels for the
processions and games, the Median spoils, and similar resources to the
amount of five hundred talents. To this he added the treasures of the
other temples. These were by no means inconsiderable, and might fairly
be used. Nay, if they were ever absolutely driven to it, they might
take even the gold ornaments of Athene herself; for the statue
contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable. This
might be used for self-preservation, and must every penny of it be
restored. Such was their financial position—surely a satisfactory one.
Then they had an army of thirteen thousand heavy infantry, besides
sixteen thousand more in the garrisons and on home duty at Athens. This
was at first the number of men on guard in the event of an invasion: it
was composed of the oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens
who had heavy armour. The Phaleric wall ran for four miles, before it
joined that round the city; and of this last nearly five had a guard,
although part of it was left without one, viz., that between the Long
Wall and the Phaleric. Then there were the Long Walls to Piraeus, a
distance of some four miles and a half, the outer of which was manned.
Lastly, the circumference of Piraeus with Munychia was nearly seven
miles and a half; only half of this, however, was guarded. Pericles
also showed them that they had twelve hundred horse including mounted
archers, with sixteen hundred archers unmounted, and three hundred
galleys fit for service. Such were the resources of Athens in the
different departments when the Peloponnesian invasion was impending and
hostilities were being commenced. Pericles also urged his usual
arguments for expecting a favourable issue to the war.

The Athenians listened to his advice, and began to carry in their wives
and children from the country, and all their household furniture, even
to the woodwork of their houses which they took down. Their sheep and
cattle they sent over to Euboea and the adjacent islands. But they
found it hard to move, as most of them had been always used to live in
the country.

From very early times this had been more the case with the Athenians
than with others. Under Cecrops and the first kings, down to the reign
of Theseus, Attica had always consisted of a number of independent
townships, each with its own town hall and magistrates. Except in times
of danger the king at Athens was not consulted; in ordinary seasons
they carried on their government and settled their affairs without his
interference; sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the case
of the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erechtheus. In Theseus,
however, they had a king of equal intelligence and power; and one of
the chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish
the council-chambers and magistrates of the petty cities, and to merge
them in the single council-chamber and town hall of the present
capital. Individuals might still enjoy their private property just as
before, but they were henceforth compelled to have only one political
centre, viz., Athens; which thus counted all the inhabitants of Attica
among her citizens, so that when Theseus died he left a great state
behind him. Indeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union;
which is paid for by the state, and which the Athenians still keep in
honour of the goddess. Before this the city consisted of the present
citadel and the district beneath it looking rather towards the south.
This is shown by the fact that the temples of the other deities,
besides that of Athene, are in the citadel; and even those that are
outside it are mostly situated in this quarter of the city, as that of
the Olympian Zeus, of the Pythian Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in
the Marshes, the same in whose honour the older Dionysia are to this
day celebrated in the month of Anthesterion not only by the Athenians
but also by their Ionian descendants. There are also other ancient
temples in this quarter. The fountain too, which, since the alteration
made by the tyrants, has been called Enneacrounos, or Nine Pipes, but
which, when the spring was open, went by the name of Callirhoe, or
Fairwater, was in those days, from being so near, used for the most
important offices. Indeed, the old fashion of using the water before
marriage and for other sacred purposes is still kept up. Again, from
their old residence in that quarter, the citadel is still known among
Athenians as the city.

The Athenians thus long lived scattered over Attica in independent
townships. Even after the centralization of Theseus, old habit still
prevailed; and from the early times down to the present war most
Athenians still lived in the country with their families and
households, and were consequently not at all inclined to move now,
especially as they had only just restored their establishments after
the Median invasion. Deep was their trouble and discontent at
abandoning their houses and the hereditary temples of the ancient
constitution, and at having to change their habits of life and to bid
farewell to what each regarded as his native city.

When they arrived at Athens, though a few had houses of their own to go
to, or could find an asylum with friends or relatives, by far the
greater number had to take up their dwelling in the parts of the city
that were not built over and in the temples and chapels of the heroes,
except the Acropolis and the temple of the Eleusinian Demeter and such
other Places as were always kept closed. The occupation of the plot of
ground lying below the citadel called the Pelasgian had been forbidden
by a curse; and there was also an ominous fragment of a Pythian oracle
which said:

Leave the Pelasgian parcel desolate, Woe worth the day that men inhabit
it!

Yet this too was now built over in the necessity of the moment. And in
my opinion, if the oracle proved true, it was in the opposite sense to
what was expected. For the misfortunes of the state did not arise from
the unlawful occupation, but the necessity of the occupation from the
war; and though the god did not mention this, he foresaw that it would
be an evil day for Athens in which the plot came to be inhabited. Many
also took up their quarters in the towers of the walls or wherever else
they could. For when they were all come in, the city proved too small
to hold them; though afterwards they divided the Long Walls and a great
part of Piraeus into lots and settled there. All this while great
attention was being given to the war; the allies were being mustered,
and an armament of a hundred ships equipped for Peloponnese. Such was
the state of preparation at Athens.

Meanwhile the army of the Peloponnesians was advancing. The first town
they came to in Attica was Oenoe, where they to enter the country.
Sitting down before it, they prepared to assault the wall with engines
and otherwise. Oenoe, standing upon the Athenian and Boeotian border,
was of course a walled town, and was used as a fortress by the
Athenians in time of war. So the Peloponnesians prepared for their
assault, and wasted some valuable time before the place. This delay
brought the gravest censure upon Archidamus. Even during the levying of
the war he had credit for weakness and Athenian sympathies by the half
measures he had advocated; and after the army had assembled he had
further injured himself in public estimation by his loitering at the
Isthmus and the slowness with which the rest of the march had been
conducted. But all this was as nothing to the delay at Oenoe. During
this interval the Athenians were carrying in their property; and it was
the belief of the Peloponnesians that a quick advance would have found
everything still out, had it not been for his procrastination. Such was
the feeling of the army towards Archidamus during the siege. But he, it
is said, expected that the Athenians would shrink from letting their
land be wasted, and would make their submission while it was still
uninjured; and this was why he waited.

But after he had assaulted Oenoe, and every possible attempt to take it
had failed, as no herald came from Athens, he at last broke up his camp
and invaded Attica. This was about eighty days after the Theban attempt
upon Plataea, just in the middle of summer, when the corn was ripe, and
Archidamus, son of Zeuxis, king of Lacedaemon, was in command.
Encamping in Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, they began their ravages,
and putting to flight some Athenian horse at a place called Rheiti, or
the Brooks, they then advanced, keeping Mount Aegaleus on their right,
through Cropia, until they reached Acharnae, the largest of the
Athenian demes or townships. Sitting down before it, they formed a camp
there, and continued their ravages for a long while.

The reason why Archidamus remained in order of battle at Acharnae
during this incursion, instead of descending into the plain, is said to
have been this. He hoped that the Athenians might possibly be tempted
by the multitude of their youth and the unprecedented efficiency of
their service to come out to battle and attempt to stop the devastation
of their lands. Accordingly, as they had met him at Eleusis or the
Thriasian plain, he tried if they could be provoked to a sally by the
spectacle of a camp at Acharnae. He thought the place itself a good
position for encamping; and it seemed likely that such an important
part of the state as the three thousand heavy infantry of the
Acharnians would refuse to submit to the ruin of their property, and
would force a battle on the rest of the citizens. On the other hand,
should the Athenians not take the field during this incursion, he could
then fearlessly ravage the plain in future invasions, and extend his
advance up to the very walls of Athens. After the Acharnians had lost
their own property they would be less willing to risk themselves for
that of their neighbours; and so there would be division in the
Athenian counsels. These were the motives of Archidamus for remaining
at Acharnae.

In the meanwhile, as long as the army was at Eleusis and the Thriasian
plain, hopes were still entertained of its not advancing any nearer. It
was remembered that Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon,
had invaded Attica with a Peloponnesian army fourteen years before, but
had retreated without advancing farther than Eleusis and Thria, which
indeed proved the cause of his exile from Sparta, as it was thought he
had been bribed to retreat. But when they saw the army at Acharnae,
barely seven miles from Athens, they lost all patience. The territory
of Athens was being ravaged before the very eyes of the Athenians, a
sight which the young men had never seen before and the old only in the
Median wars; and it was naturally thought a grievous insult, and the
determination was universal, especially among the young men, to sally
forth and stop it. Knots were formed in the streets and engaged in hot
discussion; for if the proposed sally was warmly recommended, it was
also in some cases opposed. Oracles of the most various import were
recited by the collectors, and found eager listeners in one or other of
the disputants. Foremost in pressing for the sally were the Acharnians,
as constituting no small part of the army of the state, and as it was
their land that was being ravaged. In short, the whole city was in a
most excited state; Pericles was the object of general indignation; his
previous counsels were totally forgotten; he was abused for not leading
out the army which he commanded, and was made responsible for the whole
of the public suffering.

He, meanwhile, seeing anger and infatuation just now in the ascendant,
and of his wisdom in refusing a sally, would not call either assembly
or meeting of the people, fearing the fatal results of a debate
inspired by passion and not by prudence. Accordingly he addressed
himself to the defence of the city, and kept it as quiet as possible,
though he constantly sent out cavalry to prevent raids on the lands
near the city from flying parties of the enemy. There was a trifling
affair at Phrygia between a squadron of the Athenian horse with the
Thessalians and the Boeotian cavalry; in which the former had rather
the best of it, until the heavy infantry advanced to the support of the
Boeotians, when the Thessalians and Athenians were routed and lost a
few men, whose bodies, however, were recovered the same day without a
truce. The next day the Peloponnesians set up a trophy. Ancient
alliance brought the Thessalians to the aid of Athens; those who came
being the Larisaeans, Pharsalians, Cranonians, Pyrasians, Gyrtonians,
and Pheraeans. The Larisaean commanders were Polymedes and Aristonus,
two party leaders in Larisa; the Pharsalian general was Menon; each of
the other cities had also its own commander.

In the meantime the Peloponnesians, as the Athenians did not come out
to engage them, broke up from Acharnae and ravaged some of the demes
between Mount Parnes and Brilessus. While they were in Attica the
Athenians sent off the hundred ships which they had been preparing
round Peloponnese, with a thousand heavy infantry and four hundred
archers on board, under the command of Carcinus, son of Xenotimus,
Proteas, son of Epicles, and Socrates, son of Antigenes. This armament
weighed anchor and started on its cruise, and the Peloponnesians, after
remaining in Attica as long as their provisions lasted, retired through
Boeotia by a different road to that by which they had entered. As they
passed Oropus they ravaged the territory of Graea, which is held by the
Oropians from Athens, and reaching Peloponnese broke up to their
respective cities.

After they had retired the Athenians set guards by land and sea at the
points at which they intended to have regular stations during the war.
They also resolved to set apart a special fund of a thousand talents
from the moneys in the Acropolis. This was not to be spent, but the
current expenses of the war were to be otherwise provided for. If any
one should move or put to the vote a proposition for using the money
for any purpose whatever except that of defending the city in the event
of the enemy bringing a fleet to make an attack by sea, it should be a
capital offence. With this sum of money they also set aside a special
fleet of one hundred galleys, the best ships of each year, with their
captains. None of these were to be used except with the money and
against the same peril, should such peril arise.

Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships round Peloponnese,
reinforced by a Corcyraean squadron of fifty vessels and some others of
the allies in those parts, cruised about the coasts and ravaged the
country. Among other places they landed in Laconia and made an assault
upon Methone; there being no garrison in the place, and the wall being
weak. But it so happened that Brasidas, son of Tellis, a Spartan, was
in command of a guard for the defence of the district. Hearing of the
attack, he hurried with a hundred heavy infantry to the assistance of
the besieged, and dashing through the army of the Athenians, which was
scattered over the country and had its attention turned to the wall,
threw himself into Methone. He lost a few men in making good his
entrance, but saved the place and won the thanks of Sparta by his
exploit, being thus the first officer who obtained this notice during
the war. The Athenians at once weighed anchor and continued their
cruise. Touching at Pheia in Elis, they ravaged the country for two
days and defeated a picked force of three hundred men that had come
from the vale of Elis and the immediate neighbourhood to the rescue.
But a stiff squall came down upon them, and, not liking to face it in a
place where there was no harbour, most of them got on board their
ships, and doubling Point Ichthys sailed into the port of Pheia. In the
meantime the Messenians, and some others who could not get on board,
marched over by land and took Pheia. The fleet afterwards sailed round
and picked them up and then put to sea; Pheia being evacuated, as the
main army of the Eleans had now come up. The Athenians continued their
cruise, and ravaged other places on the coast.

About the same time the Athenians sent thirty ships to cruise round
Locris and also to guard Euboea; Cleopompus, son of Clinias, being in
command. Making descents from the fleet he ravaged certain places on
the sea-coast, and captured Thronium and took hostages from it. He also
defeated at Alope the Locrians that had assembled to resist him.

During the summer the Athenians also expelled the Aeginetans with their
wives and children from Aegina, on the ground of their having been the
chief agents in bringing the war upon them. Besides, Aegina lies so
near Peloponnese that it seemed safer to send colonists of their own to
hold it, and shortly afterwards the settlers were sent out. The
banished Aeginetans found an asylum in Thyrea, which was given to them
by Lacedaemon, not only on account of her quarrel with Athens, but also
because the Aeginetans had laid her under obligations at the time of
the earthquake and the revolt of the Helots. The territory of Thyrea is
on the frontier of Argolis and Laconia, reaching down to the sea. Those
of the Aeginetans who did not settle here were scattered over the rest
of Hellas.

The same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month, the only time
by the way at which it appears possible, the sun was eclipsed after
noon. After it had assumed the form of a crescent and some of the stars
had come out, it returned to its natural shape.

During the same summer Nymphodorus, son of Pythes, an Abderite, whose
sister Sitalces had married, was made their proxenus by the Athenians
and sent for to Athens. They had hitherto considered him their enemy;
but he had great influence with Sitalces, and they wished this prince
to become their ally. Sitalces was the son of Teres and King of the
Thracians. Teres, the father of Sitalces, was the first to establish
the great kingdom of the Odrysians on a scale quite unknown to the rest
of Thrace, a large portion of the Thracians being independent. This
Teres is in no way related to Tereus who married Pandion’s daughter
Procne from Athens; nor indeed did they belong to the same part of
Thrace. Tereus lived in Daulis, part of what is now called Phocis, but
which at that time was inhabited by Thracians. It was in this land that
the women perpetrated the outrage upon Itys; and many of the poets when
they mention the nightingale call it the Daulian bird. Besides, Pandion
in contracting an alliance for his daughter would consider the
advantages of mutual assistance, and would naturally prefer a match at
the above moderate distance to the journey of many days which separates
Athens from the Odrysians. Again the names are different; and this
Teres was king of the Odrysians, the first by the way who attained to
any power. Sitalces, his son, was now sought as an ally by the
Athenians, who desired his aid in the reduction of the Thracian towns
and of Perdiccas. Coming to Athens, Nymphodorus concluded the alliance
with Sitalces and made his son Sadocus an Athenian citizen, and
promised to finish the war in Thrace by persuading Sitalces to send the
Athenians a force of Thracian horse and targeteers. He also reconciled
them with Perdiccas, and induced them to restore Therme to him; upon
which Perdiccas at once joined the Athenians and Phormio in an
expedition against the Chalcidians. Thus Sitalces, son of Teres, King
of the Thracians, and Perdiccas, son of Alexander, King of the
Macedonians, became allies of Athens.

Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels were still cruising
round Peloponnese. After taking Sollium, a town belonging to Corinth,
and presenting the city and territory to the Acarnanians of Palaira,
they stormed Astacus, expelled its tyrant Evarchus, and gained the
place for their confederacy. Next they sailed to the island of
Cephallenia and brought it over without using force. Cephallenia lies
off Acarnania and Leucas, and consists of four states, the Paleans,
Cranians, Samaeans, and Pronaeans. Not long afterwards the fleet
returned to Athens. Towards the autumn of this year the Athenians
invaded the Megarid with their whole levy, resident aliens included,
under the command of Pericles, son of Xanthippus. The Athenians in the
hundred ships round Peloponnese on their journey home had just reached
Aegina, and hearing that the citizens at home were in full force at
Megara, now sailed over and joined them. This was without doubt the
largest army of Athenians ever assembled, the state being still in the
flower of her strength and yet unvisited by the plague. Full ten
thousand heavy infantry were in the field, all Athenian citizens,
besides the three thousand before Potidæa. Then the resident aliens who
joined in the incursion were at least three thousand strong; besides
which there was a multitude of light troops. They ravaged the greater
part of the territory, and then retired. Other incursions into the
Megarid were afterwards made by the Athenians annually during the war,
sometimes only with cavalry, sometimes with all their forces. This went
on until the capture of Nisaea. Atalanta also, the desert island off
the Opuntian coast, was towards the end of this summer converted into a
fortified post by the Athenians, in order to prevent privateers issuing
from Opus and the rest of Locris and plundering Euboea. Such were the
events of this summer after the return of the Peloponnesians from
Attica.

In the ensuing winter the Acarnanian Evarchus, wishing to return to
Astacus, persuaded the Corinthians to sail over with forty ships and
fifteen hundred heavy infantry and restore him; himself also hiring
some mercenaries. In command of the force were Euphamidas, son of
Aristonymus, Timoxenus, son of Timocrates, and Eumachus, son of
Chrysis, who sailed over and restored him and, after failing in an
attempt on some places on the Acarnanian coast which they were desirous
of gaining, began their voyage home. Coasting along shore they touched
at Cephallenia and made a descent on the Cranian territory, and losing
some men by the treachery of the Cranians, who fell suddenly upon them
after having agreed to treat, put to sea somewhat hurriedly and
returned home.

In the same winter the Athenians gave a funeral at the public cost to
those who had first fallen in this war. It was a custom of their
ancestors, and the manner of it is as follows. Three days before the
ceremony, the bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been
erected; and their friends bring to their relatives such offerings as
they please. In the funeral procession cypress coffins are borne in
cars, one for each tribe; the bones of the deceased being placed in the
coffin of their tribe. Among these is carried one empty bier decked for
the missing, that is, for those whose bodies could not be recovered.
Any citizen or stranger who pleases, joins in the procession: and the
female relatives are there to wail at the burial. The dead are laid in
the public sepulchre in the Beautiful suburb of the city, in which
those who fall in war are always buried; with the exception of those
slain at Marathon, who for their singular and extraordinary valour were
interred on the spot where they fell. After the bodies have been laid
in the earth, a man chosen by the state, of approved wisdom and eminent
reputation, pronounces over them an appropriate panegyric; after which
all retire. Such is the manner of the burying; and throughout the whole
of the war, whenever the occasion arose, the established custom was
observed. Meanwhile these were the first that had fallen, and Pericles,
son of Xanthippus, was chosen to pronounce their eulogium. When the
proper time arrived, he advanced from the sepulchre to an elevated
platform in order to be heard by as many of the crowd as possible, and
spoke as follows:

“Most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made this
speech part of the law, telling us that it is well that it should be
delivered at the burial of those who fall in battle. For myself, I
should have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds
would be sufficiently rewarded by honours also shown by deeds; such as
you now see in this funeral prepared at the people’s cost. And I could
have wished that the reputations of many brave men were not to be
imperilled in the mouth of a single individual, to stand or fall
according as he spoke well or ill. For it is hard to speak properly
upon a subject where it is even difficult to convince your hearers that
you are speaking the truth. On the one hand, the friend who is familiar
with every fact of the story may think that some point has not been set
forth with that fullness which he wishes and knows it to deserve; on
the other, he who is a stranger to the matter may be led by envy to
suspect exaggeration if he hears anything above his own nature. For men
can endure to hear others praised only so long as they can severally
persuade themselves of their own ability to equal the actions
recounted: when this point is passed, envy comes in and with it
incredulity. However, since our ancestors have stamped this custom with
their approval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to
satisfy your several wishes and opinions as best I may.

“I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that they
should have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the
present. They dwelt in the country without break in the succession from
generation to generation, and handed it down free to the present time
by their valour. And if our more remote ancestors deserve praise, much
more do our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the empire
which we now possess, and spared no pains to be able to leave their
acquisitions to us of the present generation. Lastly, there are few
parts of our dominions that have not been augmented by those of us
here, who are still more or less in the vigour of life; while the
mother country has been furnished by us with everything that can enable
her to depend on her own resources whether for war or for peace. That
part of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave
us our several possessions, or of the ready valour with which either we
or our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a
theme too familiar to my hearers for me to dilate on, and I shall
therefore pass it by. But what was the road by which we reached our
position, what the form of government under which our greatness grew,
what the national habits out of which it sprang; these are questions
which I may try to solve before I proceed to my panegyric upon these
men; since I think this to be a subject upon which on the present
occasion a speaker may properly dwell, and to which the whole
assemblage, whether citizens or foreigners, may listen with advantage.

“Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are
rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration
favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a
democracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in
their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public
life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being
allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if
a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity
of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends
also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous
surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry
with our neighbour for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those
injurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they
inflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations
does not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief
safeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws,
particularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they
are actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which,
although unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.

“Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself
from business. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round,
and the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of
pleasure and helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our
city draws the produce of the world into our harbour, so that to the
Athenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as
those of his own.

“If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our
antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien
acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing,
although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our
liberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native
spirit of our citizens; while in education, where our rivals from their
very cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness, at Athens we
live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every
legitimate danger. In proof of this it may be noticed that the
Lacedaemonians do not invade our country alone, but bring with them all
their confederates; while we Athenians advance unsupported into the
territory of a neighbour, and fighting upon a foreign soil usually
vanquish with ease men who are defending their homes. Our united force
was never yet encountered by any enemy, because we have at once to
attend to our marine and to dispatch our citizens by land upon a
hundred different services; so that, wherever they engage with some
such fraction of our strength, a success against a detachment is
magnified into a victory over the nation, and a defeat into a reverse
suffered at the hands of our entire people. And yet if with habits not
of labour but of ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are
still willing to encounter danger, we have the double advantage of
escaping the experience of hardships in anticipation and of facing them
in the hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from
them.

“Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of
admiration. We cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge
without effeminacy; wealth we employ more for use than for show, and
place the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact but in
declining the struggle against it. Our public men have, besides
politics, their private affairs to attend to, and our ordinary
citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair
judges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation, regarding him
who takes no part in these duties not as unambitious but as useless, we
Athenians are able to judge at all events if we cannot originate, and,
instead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of
action, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at
all. Again, in our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of
daring and deliberation, each carried to its highest point, and both
united in the same persons; although usually decision is the fruit of
ignorance, hesitation of reflection. But the palm of courage will
surely be adjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference
between hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from
danger. In generosity we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by
conferring, not by receiving, favours. Yet, of course, the doer of the
favour is the firmer friend of the two, in order by continued kindness
to keep the recipient in his debt; while the debtor feels less keenly
from the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a payment,
not a free gift. And it is only the Athenians, who, fearless of
consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of
expediency, but in the confidence of liberality.

“In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas, while I
doubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to
depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a
versatility, as the Athenian. And that this is no mere boast thrown out
for the occasion, but plain matter of fact, the power of the state
acquired by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her contemporaries
is found when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives
no occasion to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they
have been worsted, or to her subjects to question her title by merit to
rule. Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be
ours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown
it by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our panegyrist,
or other of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for
the impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have
forced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and
everywhere, whether for evil or for good, have left imperishable
monuments behind us. Such is the Athens for which these men, in the
assertion of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and
well may every one of their survivors be ready to suffer in her cause.

“Indeed if I have dwelt at some length upon the character of our
country, it has been to show that our stake in the struggle is not the
same as theirs who have no such blessings to lose, and also that the
panegyric of the men over whom I am now speaking might be by definite
proofs established. That panegyric is now in a great measure complete;
for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these
and their like have made her, men whose fame, unlike that of most
Hellenes, will be found to be only commensurate with their deserts. And
if a test of worth be wanted, it is to be found in their closing scene,
and this not only in cases in which it set the final seal upon their
merit, but also in those in which it gave the first intimation of their
having any. For there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in his
country’s battles should be as a cloak to cover a man’s other
imperfections; since the good action has blotted out the bad, and his
merit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits as an individual.
But none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future
enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of
freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that
vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal
blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they
joyfully determined to accept the risk, to make sure of their
vengeance, and to let their wishes wait; and while committing to hope
the uncertainty of final success, in the business before them they
thought fit to act boldly and trust in themselves. Thus choosing to die
resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from
dishonour, but met danger face to face, and after one brief moment,
while at the summit of their fortune, escaped, not from their fear, but
from their glory.

“So died these men as became Athenians. You, their survivors, must
determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you
may pray that it may have a happier issue. And not contented with ideas
derived only from words of the advantages which are bound up with the
defence of your country, though these would furnish a valuable text to
a speaker even before an audience so alive to them as the present, you
must yourselves realize the power of Athens, and feed your eyes upon
her from day to day, till love of her fills your hearts; and then, when
all her greatness shall break upon you, you must reflect that it was by
courage, sense of duty, and a keen feeling of honour in action that men
were enabled to win all this, and that no personal failure in an
enterprise could make them consent to deprive their country of their
valour, but they laid it at her feet as the most glorious contribution
that they could offer. For this offering of their lives made in common
by them all they each of them individually received that renown which
never grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so much that in which their
bones have been deposited, but that noblest of shrines wherein their
glory is laid up to be eternally remembered upon every occasion on
which deed or story shall call for its commemoration. For heroes have
the whole earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where
the column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every
breast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except that of
the heart. These take as your model and, judging happiness to be the
fruit of freedom and freedom of valour, never decline the dangers of
war. For it is not the miserable that would most justly be unsparing of
their lives; these have nothing to hope for: it is rather they to whom
continued life may bring reverses as yet unknown, and to whom a fall,
if it came, would be most tremendous in its consequences. And surely,
to a man of spirit, the degradation of cowardice must be immeasurably
more grievous than the unfelt death which strikes him in the midst of
his strength and patriotism!

“Comfort, therefore, not condolence, is what I have to offer to the
parents of the dead who may be here. Numberless are the chances to
which, as they know, the life of man is subject; but fortunate indeed
are they who draw for their lot a death so glorious as that which has
caused your mourning, and to whom life has been so exactly measured as
to terminate in the happiness in which it has been passed. Still I know
that this is a hard saying, especially when those are in question of
whom you will constantly be reminded by seeing in the homes of others
blessings of which once you also boasted: for grief is felt not so much
for the want of what we have never known, as for the loss of that to
which we have been long accustomed. Yet you who are still of an age to
beget children must bear up in the hope of having others in their
stead; not only will they help you to forget those whom you have lost,
but will be to the state at once a reinforcement and a security; for
never can a fair or just policy be expected of the citizen who does
not, like his fellows, bring to the decision the interests and
apprehensions of a father. While those of you who have passed your
prime must congratulate yourselves with the thought that the best part
of your life was fortunate, and that the brief span that remains will
be cheered by the fame of the departed. For it is only the love of
honour that never grows old; and honour it is, not gain, as some would
have it, that rejoices the heart of age and helplessness.

“Turning to the sons or brothers of the dead, I see an arduous struggle
before you. When a man is gone, all are wont to praise him, and should
your merit be ever so transcendent, you will still find it difficult
not merely to overtake, but even to approach their renown. The living
have envy to contend with, while those who are no longer in our path
are honoured with a goodwill into which rivalry does not enter. On the
other hand, if I must say anything on the subject of female excellence
to those of you who will now be in widowhood, it will be all comprised
in this brief exhortation. Great will be your glory in not falling
short of your natural character; and greatest will be hers who is least
talked of among the men, whether for good or for bad.

“My task is now finished. I have performed it to the best of my
ability, and in word, at least, the requirements of the law are now
satisfied. If deeds be in question, those who are here interred have
received part of their honours already, and for the rest, their
children will be brought up till manhood at the public expense: the
state thus offers a valuable prize, as the garland of victory in this
race of valour, for the reward both of those who have fallen and their
survivors. And where the rewards for merit are greatest, there are
found the best citizens.

“And now that you have brought to a close your lamentations for your
relatives, you may depart.”




CHAPTER VII


Second Year of the War—The Plague of Athens—Position and Policy of
Pericles—Fall of Potidæa


Such was the funeral that took place during this winter, with which the
first year of the war came to an end. In the first days of summer the
Lacedaemonians and their allies, with two-thirds of their forces as
before, invaded Attica, under the command of Archidamus, son of
Zeuxidamus, King of Lacedaemon, and sat down and laid waste the
country. Not many days after their arrival in Attica the plague first
began to show itself among the Athenians. It was said that it had
broken out in many places previously in the neighbourhood of Lemnos and
elsewhere; but a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere
remembered. Neither were the physicians at first of any service,
ignorant as they were of the proper way to treat it, but they died
themselves the most thickly, as they visited the sick most often; nor
did any human art succeed any better. Supplications in the temples,
divinations, and so forth were found equally futile, till the
overwhelming nature of the disaster at last put a stop to them
altogether.

It first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above Egypt, and
thence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most of the King’s
country. Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first attacked the population
in Piraeus—which was the occasion of their saying that the
Peloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs, there being as yet no wells
there—and afterwards appeared in the upper city, when the deaths became
much more frequent. All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if
causes can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave
to other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall
simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps
it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again.
This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its
operation in the case of others.

That year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free
from sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this.
As a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good
health were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and
redness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the
throat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid
breath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after
which the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When
it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every
kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress. In
most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent
spasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.
Externally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its
appearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules
and ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear
to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description;
or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked
best would have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was
done by some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in
their agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference
whether they drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling
of not being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The
body meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its
height, but held out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when they
succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the
internal inflammation, they had still some strength in them. But if
they passed this stage, and the disease descended further into the
bowels, inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe
diarrhoea, this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal. For
the disorder first settled in the head, ran its course from thence
through the whole of the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal,
it still left its mark on the extremities; for it settled in the privy
parts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the loss of
these, some too with that of their eyes. Others again were seized with
an entire loss of memory on their first recovery, and did not know
either themselves or their friends.

But while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all
description, and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to
endure, it was still in the following circumstance that its difference
from all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the birds and
beasts that prey upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them
(though there were many lying unburied), or died after tasting them. In
proof of this, it was noticed that birds of this kind actually
disappeared; they were not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at
all. But of course the effects which I have mentioned could best be
studied in a domestic animal like the dog.

Such then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were
many and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper.
Meanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders;
or if any case occurred, it ended in this. Some died in neglect, others
in the midst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used
as a specific; for what did good in one case, did harm in another.
Strong and weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance,
all alike being swept away, although dieted with the utmost precaution.
By far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which
ensued when any one felt himself sickening, for the despair into which
they instantly fell took away their power of resistance, and left them
a much easier prey to the disorder; besides which, there was the awful
spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection
in nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. On the one
hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from
neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a
nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the
consequence. This was especially the case with such as made any
pretensions to goodness: honour made them unsparing of themselves in
their attendance in their friends’ houses, where even the members of
the family were at last worn out by the moans of the dying, and
succumbed to the force of the disaster. Yet it was with those who had
recovered from the disease that the sick and the dying found most
compassion. These knew what it was from experience, and had now no fear
for themselves; for the same man was never attacked twice—never at
least fatally. And such persons not only received the congratulations
of others, but themselves also, in the elation of the moment, half
entertained the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any
disease whatsoever.

An aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country
into the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals. As
there were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot
season of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged
without restraint. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and
half-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the
fountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which
they had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had
died there, just as they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds,
men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of
everything, whether sacred or profane. All the burial rites before in
use were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could.
Many from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their
friends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless
sepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile,
they threw their own dead body upon the stranger’s pyre and ignited it;
sometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of
another that was burning, and so went off.

Nor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its
origin to the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly
done in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid
transitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those
who before had nothing succeeding to their property. So they resolved
to spend quickly and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches
as alike things of a day. Perseverance in what men called honour was
popular with none, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to
attain the object; but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all
that contributed to it, was both honourable and useful. Fear of gods or
law of man there was none to restrain them. As for the first, they
judged it to be just the same whether they worshipped them or not, as
they saw all alike perishing; and for the last, no one expected to live
to be brought to trial for his offences, but each felt that a far
severer sentence had been already passed upon them all and hung ever
over their heads, and before this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy
life a little.

Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on the
Athenians; death raging within the city and devastation without. Among
other things which they remembered in their distress was, very
naturally, the following verse which the old men said had long ago been
uttered:

A Dorian war shall come and with it death.


So a dispute arose as to whether dearth and not death had not been the
word in the verse; but at the present juncture, it was of course
decided in favour of the latter; for the people made their recollection
fit in with their sufferings. I fancy, however, that if another Dorian
war should ever afterwards come upon us, and a dearth should happen to
accompany it, the verse will probably be read accordingly. The oracle
also which had been given to the Lacedaemonians was now remembered by
those who knew of it. When the god was asked whether they should go to
war, he answered that if they put their might into it, victory would be
theirs, and that he would himself be with them. With this oracle events
were supposed to tally. For the plague broke out as soon as the
Peloponnesians invaded Attica, and never entering Peloponnese (not at
least to an extent worth noticing), committed its worst ravages at
Athens, and next to Athens, at the most populous of the other towns.
Such was the history of the plague.

After ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians advanced into the Paralian
region as far as Laurium, where the Athenian silver mines are, and
first laid waste the side looking towards Peloponnese, next that which
faces Euboea and Andros. But Pericles, who was still general, held the
same opinion as in the former invasion, and would not let the Athenians
march out against them.

However, while they were still in the plain, and had not yet entered
the Paralian land, he had prepared an armament of a hundred ships for
Peloponnese, and when all was ready put out to sea. On board the ships
he took four thousand Athenian heavy infantry, and three hundred
cavalry in horse transports, and then for the first time made out of
old galleys; fifty Chian and Lesbian vessels also joining in the
expedition. When this Athenian armament put out to sea, they left the
Peloponnesians in Attica in the Paralian region. Arriving at Epidaurus
in Peloponnese they ravaged most of the territory, and even had hopes
of taking the town by an assault: in this however they were not
successful. Putting out from Epidaurus, they laid waste the territory
of Troezen, Halieis, and Hermione, all towns on the coast of
Peloponnese, and thence sailing to Prasiai, a maritime town in Laconia,
ravaged part of its territory, and took and sacked the place itself;
after which they returned home, but found the Peloponnesians gone and
no longer in Attica.

During the whole time that the Peloponnesians were in Attica and the
Athenians on the expedition in their ships, men kept dying of the
plague both in the armament and in Athens. Indeed it was actually
asserted that the departure of the Peloponnesians was hastened by fear
of the disorder; as they heard from deserters that it was in the city,
and also could see the burials going on. Yet in this invasion they
remained longer than in any other, and ravaged the whole country, for
they were about forty days in Attica.

The same summer Hagnon, son of Nicias, and Cleopompus, son of Clinias,
the colleagues of Pericles, took the armament of which he had lately
made use, and went off upon an expedition against the Chalcidians in
the direction of Thrace and Potidæa, which was still under siege. As
soon as they arrived, they brought up their engines against Potidæa and
tried every means of taking it, but did not succeed either in capturing
the city or in doing anything else worthy of their preparations. For
the plague attacked them here also, and committed such havoc as to
cripple them completely, even the previously healthy soldiers of the
former expedition catching the infection from Hagnon’s troops; while
Phormio and the sixteen hundred men whom he commanded only escaped by
being no longer in the neighbourhood of the Chalcidians. The end of it
was that Hagnon returned with his ships to Athens, having lost one
thousand and fifty out of four thousand heavy infantry in about forty
days; though the soldiers stationed there before remained in the
country and carried on the siege of Potidæa.

After the second invasion of the Peloponnesians a change came over the
spirit of the Athenians. Their land had now been twice laid waste; and
war and pestilence at once pressed heavy upon them. They began to find
fault with Pericles, as the author of the war and the cause of all
their misfortunes, and became eager to come to terms with Lacedaemon,
and actually sent ambassadors thither, who did not however succeed in
their mission. Their despair was now complete and all vented itself
upon Pericles. When he saw them exasperated at the present turn of
affairs and acting exactly as he had anticipated, he called an
assembly, being (it must be remembered) still general, with the double
object of restoring confidence and of leading them from these angry
feelings to a calmer and more hopeful state of mind. He accordingly
came forward and spoke as follows:

“I was not unprepared for the indignation of which I have been the
object, as I know its causes; and I have called an assembly for the
purpose of reminding you upon certain points, and of protesting against
your being unreasonably irritated with me, or cowed by your sufferings.
I am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of
private citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public
humiliation. A man may be personally ever so well off, and yet if his
country be ruined he must be ruined with it; whereas a flourishing
commonwealth always affords chances of salvation to unfortunate
individuals. Since then a state can support the misfortunes of private
citizens, while they cannot support hers, it is surely the duty of
every one to be forward in her defence, and not like you to be so
confounded with your domestic afflictions as to give up all thoughts of
the common safety, and to blame me for having counselled war and
yourselves for having voted it. And yet if you are angry with me, it is
with one who, as I believe, is second to no man either in knowledge of
the proper policy, or in the ability to expound it, and who is moreover
not only a patriot but an honest one. A man possessing that knowledge
without that faculty of exposition might as well have no idea at all on
the matter: if he had both these gifts, but no love for his country, he
would be but a cold advocate for her interests; while were his
patriotism not proof against bribery, everything would go for a price.
So that if you thought that I was even moderately distinguished for
these qualities when you took my advice and went to war, there is
certainly no reason now why I should be charged with having done wrong.

“For those of course who have a free choice in the matter and whose
fortunes are not at stake, war is the greatest of follies. But if the
only choice was between submission with loss of independence, and
danger with the hope of preserving that independence, in such a case it
is he who will not accept the risk that deserves blame, not he who
will. I am the same man and do not alter, it is you who change, since
in fact you took my advice while unhurt, and waited for misfortune to
repent of it; and the apparent error of my policy lies in the infirmity
of your resolution, since the suffering that it entails is being felt
by every one among you, while its advantage is still remote and obscure
to all, and a great and sudden reverse having befallen you, your mind
is too much depressed to persevere in your resolves. For before what is
sudden, unexpected, and least within calculation, the spirit quails;
and putting all else aside, the plague has certainly been an emergency
of this kind. Born, however, as you are, citizens of a great state, and
brought up, as you have been, with habits equal to your birth, you
should be ready to face the greatest disasters and still to keep
unimpaired the lustre of your name. For the judgment of mankind is as
relentless to the weakness that falls short of a recognized renown, as
it is jealous of the arrogance that aspires higher than its due. Cease
then to grieve for your private afflictions, and address yourselves
instead to the safety of the commonwealth.

“If you shrink before the exertions which the war makes necessary, and
fear that after all they may not have a happy result, you know the
reasons by which I have often demonstrated to you the groundlessness of
your apprehensions. If those are not enough, I will now reveal an
advantage arising from the greatness of your dominion, which I think
has never yet suggested itself to you, which I never mentioned in my
previous speeches, and which has so bold a sound that I should scarce
adventure it now, were it not for the unnatural depression which I see
around me. You perhaps think that your empire extends only over your
allies; I will declare to you the truth. The visible field of action
has two parts, land and sea. In the whole of one of these you are
completely supreme, not merely as far as you use it at present, but
also to what further extent you may think fit: in fine, your naval
resources are such that your vessels may go where they please, without
the King or any other nation on earth being able to stop them. So that
although you may think it a great privation to lose the use of your
land and houses, still you must see that this power is something widely
different; and instead of fretting on their account, you should really
regard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories that
embellish a great fortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment. You
should know too that liberty preserved by your efforts will easily
recover for us what we have lost, while, the knee once bowed, even what
you have will pass from you. Your fathers receiving these possessions
not from others, but from themselves, did not let slip what their
labour had acquired, but delivered them safe to you; and in this
respect at least you must prove yourselves their equals, remembering
that to lose what one has got is more disgraceful than to be balked in
getting, and you must confront your enemies not merely with spirit but
with disdain. Confidence indeed a blissful ignorance can impart, ay,
even to a coward’s breast, but disdain is the privilege of those who,
like us, have been assured by reflection of their superiority to their
adversary. And where the chances are the same, knowledge fortifies
courage by the contempt which is its consequence, its trust being
placed, not in hope, which is the prop of the desperate, but in a
judgment grounded upon existing resources, whose anticipations are more
to be depended upon.

“Again, your country has a right to your services in sustaining the
glories of her position. These are a common source of pride to you all,
and you cannot decline the burdens of empire and still expect to share
its honours. You should remember also that what you are fighting
against is not merely slavery as an exchange for independence, but also
loss of empire and danger from the animosities incurred in its
exercise. Besides, to recede is no longer possible, if indeed any of
you in the alarm of the moment has become enamoured of the honesty of
such an unambitious part. For what you hold is, to speak somewhat
plainly, a tyranny; to take it perhaps was wrong, but to let it go is
unsafe. And men of these retiring views, making converts of others,
would quickly ruin a state; indeed the result would be the same if they
could live independent by themselves; for the retiring and unambitious
are never secure without vigorous protectors at their side; in fine,
such qualities are useless to an imperial city, though they may help a
dependency to an unmolested servitude.

“But you must not be seduced by citizens like these or angry with
me—who, if I voted for war, only did as you did yourselves—in spite of
the enemy having invaded your country and done what you could be
certain that he would do, if you refused to comply with his demands;
and although besides what we counted for, the plague has come upon
us—the only point indeed at which our calculation has been at fault. It
is this, I know, that has had a large share in making me more unpopular
than I should otherwise have been—quite undeservedly, unless you are
also prepared to give me the credit of any success with which chance
may present you. Besides, the hand of heaven must be borne with
resignation, that of the enemy with fortitude; this was the old way at
Athens, and do not you prevent it being so still. Remember, too, that
if your country has the greatest name in all the world, it is because
she never bent before disaster; because she has expended more life and
effort in war than any other city, and has won for herself a power
greater than any hitherto known, the memory of which will descend to
the latest posterity; even if now, in obedience to the general law of
decay, we should ever be forced to yield, still it will be remembered
that we held rule over more Hellenes than any other Hellenic state,
that we sustained the greatest wars against their united or separate
powers, and inhabited a city unrivalled by any other in resources or
magnitude. These glories may incur the censure of the slow and
unambitious; but in the breast of energy they will awake emulation, and
in those who must remain without them an envious regret. Hatred and
unpopularity at the moment have fallen to the lot of all who have
aspired to rule others; but where odium must be incurred, true wisdom
incurs it for the highest objects. Hatred also is short-lived; but that
which makes the splendour of the present and the glory of the future
remains for ever unforgotten. Make your decision, therefore, for glory
then and honour now, and attain both objects by instant and zealous
effort: do not send heralds to Lacedaemon, and do not betray any sign
of being oppressed by your present sufferings, since they whose minds
are least sensitive to calamity, and whose hands are most quick to meet
it, are the greatest men and the greatest communities.”

Such were the arguments by which Pericles tried to cure the Athenians
of their anger against him and to divert their thoughts from their
immediate afflictions. As a community he succeeded in convincing them;
they not only gave up all idea of sending to Lacedaemon, but applied
themselves with increased energy to the war; still as private
individuals they could not help smarting under their sufferings, the
common people having been deprived of the little that they were
possessed, while the higher orders had lost fine properties with costly
establishments and buildings in the country, and, worst of all, had war
instead of peace. In fact, the public feeling against him did not
subside until he had been fined. Not long afterwards, however,
according to the way of the multitude, they again elected him general
and committed all their affairs to his hands, having now become less
sensitive to their private and domestic afflictions, and understanding
that he was the best man of all for the public necessities. For as long
as he was at the head of the state during the peace, he pursued a
moderate and conservative policy; and in his time its greatness was at
its height. When the war broke out, here also he seems to have rightly
gauged the power of his country. He outlived its commencement two years
and six months, and the correctness of his previsions respecting it
became better known by his death. He told them to wait quietly, to pay
attention to their marine, to attempt no new conquests, and to expose
the city to no hazards during the war, and doing this, promised them a
favourable result. What they did was the very contrary, allowing
private ambitions and private interests, in matters apparently quite
foreign to the war, to lead them into projects unjust both to
themselves and to their allies—projects whose success would only
conduce to the honour and advantage of private persons, and whose
failure entailed certain disaster on the country in the war. The causes
of this are not far to seek. Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and
known integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over
the multitude—in short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for
as he never sought power by improper means, he was never compelled to
flatter them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that
he could afford to anger them by contradiction. Whenever he saw them
unseasonably and insolently elated, he would with a word reduce them to
alarm; on the other hand, if they fell victims to a panic, he could at
once restore them to confidence. In short, what was nominally a
democracy became in his hands government by the first citizen. With his
successors it was different. More on a level with one another, and each
grasping at supremacy, they ended by committing even the conduct of
state affairs to the whims of the multitude. This, as might have been
expected in a great and sovereign state, produced a host of blunders,
and amongst them the Sicilian expedition; though this failed not so
much through a miscalculation of the power of those against whom it was
sent, as through a fault in the senders in not taking the best measures
afterwards to assist those who had gone out, but choosing rather to
occupy themselves with private cabals for the leadership of the
commons, by which they not only paralysed operations in the field, but
also first introduced civil discord at home. Yet after losing most of
their fleet besides other forces in Sicily, and with faction already
dominant in the city, they could still for three years make head
against their original adversaries, joined not only by the Sicilians,
but also by their own allies nearly all in revolt, and at last by the
King’s son, Cyrus, who furnished the funds for the Peloponnesian navy.
Nor did they finally succumb till they fell the victims of their own
intestine disorders. So superfluously abundant were the resources from
which the genius of Pericles foresaw an easy triumph in the war over
the unaided forces of the Peloponnesians.

During the same summer the Lacedaemonians and their allies made an
expedition with a hundred ships against Zacynthus, an island lying off
the coast of Elis, peopled by a colony of Achaeans from Peloponnese,
and in alliance with Athens. There were a thousand Lacedaemonian heavy
infantry on board, and Cnemus, a Spartan, as admiral. They made a
descent from their ships, and ravaged most of the country; but as the
inhabitants would not submit, they sailed back home.

At the end of the same summer the Corinthian Aristeus, Aneristus,
Nicolaus, and Stratodemus, envoys from Lacedaemon, Timagoras, a Tegean,
and a private individual named Pollis from Argos, on their way to Asia
to persuade the King to supply funds and join in the war, came to
Sitalces, son of Teres in Thrace, with the idea of inducing him, if
possible, to forsake the alliance of Athens and to march on Potidæa
then besieged by an Athenian force, and also of getting conveyed by his
means to their destination across the Hellespont to Pharnabazus, who
was to send them up the country to the King. But there chanced to be
with Sitalces some Athenian ambassadors—Learchus, son of Callimachus,
and Ameiniades, son of Philemon—who persuaded Sitalces’ son, Sadocus,
the new Athenian citizen, to put the men into their hands and thus
prevent their crossing over to the King and doing their part to injure
the country of his choice. He accordingly had them seized, as they were
travelling through Thrace to the vessel in which they were to cross the
Hellespont, by a party whom he had sent on with Learchus and
Ameiniades, and gave orders for their delivery to the Athenian
ambassadors, by whom they were brought to Athens. On their arrival, the
Athenians, afraid that Aristeus, who had been notably the prime mover
in the previous affairs of Potidæa and their Thracian possessions,
might live to do them still more mischief if he escaped, slew them all
the same day, without giving them a trial or hearing the defence which
they wished to offer, and cast their bodies into a pit; thinking
themselves justified in using in retaliation the same mode of warfare
which the Lacedaemonians had begun, when they slew and cast into pits
all the Athenian and allied traders whom they caught on board the
merchantmen round Peloponnese. Indeed, at the outset of the war, the
Lacedaemonians butchered as enemies all whom they took on the sea,
whether allies of Athens or neutrals.

About the same time towards the close of the summer, the Ambraciot
forces, with a number of barbarians that they had raised, marched
against the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country. The origin
of their enmity against the Argives was this. This Argos and the rest
of Amphilochia were colonized by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus.
Dissatisfied with the state of affairs at home on his return thither
after the Trojan War, he built this city in the Ambracian Gulf, and
named it Argos after his own country. This was the largest town in
Amphilochia, and its inhabitants the most powerful. Under the pressure
of misfortune many generations afterwards, they called in the
Ambraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, to join their
colony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that they learnt
their present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians being
barbarians. After a time the Ambraciots expelled the Argives and held
the city themselves. Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves over
to the Acarnanians; and the two together called the Athenians, who sent
them Phormio as general and thirty ships; upon whose arrival they took
Argos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; and the
Amphilochians and Acarnanians inhabited the town in common. After this
began the alliance between the Athenians and Acarnanians. The enmity of
the Ambraciots against the Argives thus commenced with the enslavement
of their citizens; and afterwards during the war they collected this
armament among themselves and the Chaonians, and other of the
neighbouring barbarians. Arrived before Argos, they became masters of
the country; but not being successful in their attacks upon the town,
returned home and dispersed among their different peoples.

Such were the events of the summer. The ensuing winter the Athenians
sent twenty ships round Peloponnese, under the command of Phormio, who
stationed himself at Naupactus and kept watch against any one sailing
in or out of Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf. Six others went to Caria
and Lycia under Melesander, to collect tribute in those parts, and also
to prevent the Peloponnesian privateers from taking up their station in
those waters and molesting the passage of the merchantmen from Phaselis
and Phoenicia and the adjoining continent. However, Melesander, going
up the country into Lycia with a force of Athenians from the ships and
the allies, was defeated and killed in battle, with the loss of a
number of his troops.

The same winter the Potidæans at length found themselves no longer able
to hold out against their besiegers. The inroads of the Peloponnesians
into Attica had not had the desired effect of making the Athenians
raise the siege. Provisions there were none left; and so far had
distress for food gone in Potidæa that, besides a number of other
horrors, instances had even occurred of the people having eaten one
another. In this extremity they at last made proposals for capitulating
to the Athenian generals in command against them—Xenophon, son of
Euripides, Hestiodorus, son of Aristocleides, and Phanomachus, son of
Callimachus. The generals accepted their proposals, seeing the
sufferings of the army in so exposed a position; besides which the
state had already spent two thousand talents upon the siege. The terms
of the capitulation were as follows: a free passage out for themselves,
their children, wives and auxiliaries, with one garment apiece, the
women with two, and a fixed sum of money for their journey. Under this
treaty they went out to Chalcidice and other places, according as was
their power. The Athenians, however, blamed the generals for granting
terms without instructions from home, being of opinion that the place
would have had to surrender at discretion. They afterwards sent
settlers of their own to Potidæa, and colonized it. Such were the
events of the winter, and so ended the second year of this war of which
Thucydides was the historian.




CHAPTER VIII


Third Year of the War—Investment of Plataea—Naval Victories of
Phormio—Thracian Irruption into Macedonia under Sitalces


The next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, instead of
invading Attica, marched against Plataea, under the command of
Archidamus, son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. He had
encamped his army and was about to lay waste the country, when the
Plataeans hastened to send envoys to him, and spoke as follows:
“Archidamus and Lacedaemonians, in invading the Plataean territory, you
do what is wrong in itself, and worthy neither of yourselves nor of the
fathers who begot you. Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, your countryman,
after freeing Hellas from the Medes with the help of those Hellenes who
were willing to undertake the risk of the battle fought near our city,
offered sacrifice to Zeus the Liberator in the marketplace of Plataea,
and calling all the allies together restored to the Plataeans their
city and territory, and declared it independent and inviolate against
aggression or conquest. Should any such be attempted, the allies
present were to help according to their power. Your fathers rewarded us
thus for the courage and patriotism that we displayed at that perilous
epoch; but you do just the contrary, coming with our bitterest enemies,
the Thebans, to enslave us. We appeal, therefore, to the gods to whom
the oaths were then made, to the gods of your ancestors, and lastly to
those of our country, and call upon you to refrain from violating our
territory or transgressing the oaths, and to let us live independent,
as Pausanias decreed.”

The Plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by Archidamus
saying: “There is justice, Plataeans, in what you say, if you act up to
your words. According, to the grant of Pausanias, continue to be
independent yourselves, and join in freeing those of your fellow
countrymen who, after sharing in the perils of that period, joined in
the oaths to you, and are now subject to the Athenians; for it is to
free them and the rest that all this provision and war has been made. I
could wish that you would share our labours and abide by the oaths
yourselves; if this is impossible, do what we have already required of
you—remain neutral, enjoying your own; join neither side, but receive
both as friends, neither as allies for the war. With this we shall be
satisfied.” Such were the words of Archidamus. The Plataeans, after
hearing what he had to say, went into the city and acquainted the
people with what had passed, and presently returned for answer that it
was impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the
Athenians, with whom their children and wives now were; besides which
they had their fears for the town. After his departure, what was to
prevent the Athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands, or
the Thebans, who would be included in the oaths, from taking advantage
of the proposed neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city?
Upon these points he tried to reassure them by saying: “You have only
to deliver over the city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, to point out
the boundaries of your land, the number of your fruit-trees, and
whatever else can be numerically stated, and yourselves to withdraw
wherever you like as long as the war shall last. When it is over we
will restore to you whatever we received, and in the interim hold it in
trust and keep it in cultivation, paying you a sufficient allowance.”

When they had heard what he had to say, they re-entered the city, and
after consulting with the people said that they wished first to
acquaint the Athenians with this proposal, and in the event of their
approving to accede to it; in the meantime they asked him to grant them
a truce and not to lay waste their territory. He accordingly granted a
truce for the number of days requisite for the journey, and meanwhile
abstained from ravaging their territory. The Plataean envoys went to
Athens, and consulted with the Athenians, and returned with the
following message to those in the city: “The Athenians say, Plataeans,
that they never hitherto, since we became their allies, on any occasion
abandoned us to an enemy, nor will they now neglect us, but will help
us according to their ability; and they adjure you by the oaths which
your fathers swore, to keep the alliance unaltered.”

On the delivery of this message by the envoys, the Plataeans resolved
not to be unfaithful to the Athenians but to endure, if it must be,
seeing their lands laid waste and any other trials that might come to
them, and not to send out again, but to answer from the wall that it
was impossible for them to do as the Lacedaemonians proposed. As soon
as he had received this answer, King Archidamus proceeded first to make
a solemn appeal to the gods and heroes of the country in words
following: “Ye gods and heroes of the Plataean territory, be my
witnesses that not as aggressors originally, nor until these had first
departed from the common oath, did we invade this land, in which our
fathers offered you their prayers before defeating the Medes, and which
you made auspicious to the Hellenic arms; nor shall we be aggressors in
the measures to which we may now resort, since we have made many fair
proposals but have not been successful. Graciously accord that those
who were the first to offend may be punished for it, and that vengeance
may be attained by those who would righteously inflict it.”

After this appeal to the gods Archidamus put his army in motion. First
he enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit-trees which
they cut down, to prevent further egress from Plataea; next they threw
up a mound against the city, hoping that the largeness of the force
employed would ensure the speedy reduction of the place. They
accordingly cut down timber from Cithaeron, and built it up on either
side, laying it like lattice-work to serve as a wall to keep the mound
from spreading abroad, and carried to it wood and stones and earth and
whatever other material might help to complete it. They continued to
work at the mound for seventy days and nights without intermission,
being divided into relief parties to allow of some being employed in
carrying while others took sleep and refreshment; the Lacedaemonian
officer attached to each contingent keeping the men to the work. But
the Plataeans, observing the progress of the mound, constructed a wall
of wood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which the
mound was being erected, and built up bricks inside it which they took
from the neighbouring houses. The timbers served to bind the building
together, and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height; it
had also a covering of skins and hides, which protected the woodwork
against the attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work in
safety. Thus the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound
opposite made no less rapid progress. The Plataeans also thought of
another expedient; they pulled out part of the wall upon which the
mound abutted, and carried the earth into the city.

Discovering this the Peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles of reed
and threw it into the breach formed in the mound, in order to give it
consistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil. Stopped
in this way the Plataeans changed their mode of operation, and digging
a mine from the town calculated their way under the mound, and began to
carry off its material as before. This went on for a long while without
the enemy outside finding it out, so that for all they threw on the top
their mound made no progress in proportion, being carried away from
beneath and constantly settling down in the vacuum. But the Plataeans,
fearing that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the
superior numbers of the enemy, had yet another invention. They stopped
working at the large building in front of the mound, and starting at
either end of it inside from the old low wall, built a new one in the
form of a crescent running in towards the town; in order that in the
event of the great wall being taken this might remain, and the enemy
have to throw up a fresh mound against it, and as they advanced within
might not only have their trouble over again, but also be exposed to
missiles on their flanks. While raising the mound the Peloponnesians
also brought up engines against the city, one of which was brought up
upon the mound against the great building and shook down a good piece
of it, to the no small alarm of the Plataeans. Others were advanced
against different parts of the wall but were lassoed and broken by the
Plataeans; who also hung up great beams by long iron chains from either
extremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting over it, and
drew them up at an angle whenever any point was threatened by the
engine, and loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack,
so that it fell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering
ram.

After this the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines effected
nothing, and that their mound was met by the counterwork, concluded
that their present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the
city, and prepared for its circumvallation. First, however, they
determined to try the effects of fire and see whether they could not,
with the help of a wind, burn the town, as it was not a large one;
indeed they thought of every possible expedient by which the place
might be reduced without the expense of a blockade. They accordingly
brought faggots of brushwood and threw them from the mound, first into
the space between it and the wall; and this soon becoming full from the
number of hands at work, they next heaped the faggots up as far into
the town as they could reach from the top, and then lighted the wood by
setting fire to it with sulphur and pitch. The consequence was a fire
greater than any one had ever yet seen produced by human agency, though
it could not of course be compared to the spontaneous conflagrations
sometimes known to occur through the wind rubbing the branches of a
mountain forest together. And this fire was not only remarkable for its
magnitude, but was also, at the end of so many perils, within an ace of
proving fatal to the Plataeans; a great part of the town became
entirely inaccessible, and had a wind blown upon it, in accordance with
the hopes of the enemy, nothing could have saved them. As it was, there
is also a story of heavy rain and thunder having come on by which the
fire was put out and the danger averted.

Failing in this last attempt the Peloponnesians left a portion of their
forces on the spot, dismissing the rest, and built a wall of
circumvallation round the town, dividing the ground among the various
cities present; a ditch being made within and without the lines, from
which they got their bricks. All being finished by about the rising of
Arcturus, they left men enough to man half the wall, the rest being
manned by the Boeotians, and drawing off their army dispersed to their
several cities. The Plataeans had before sent off their wives and
children and oldest men and the mass of the non-combatants to Athens;
so that the number of the besieged left in the place comprised four
hundred of their own citizens, eighty Athenians, and a hundred and ten
women to bake their bread. This was the sum total at the commencement
of the siege, and there was no one else within the walls, bond or free.
Such were the arrangements made for the blockade of Plataea.

The same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against Plataea,
the Athenians marched with two thousand heavy infantry and two hundred
horse against the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace and the
Bottiaeans, just as the corn was getting ripe, under the command of
Xenophon, son of Euripides, with two colleagues. Arriving before
Spartolus in Bottiaea, they destroyed the corn and had some hopes of
the city coming over through the intrigues of a faction within. But
those of a different way of thinking had sent to Olynthus; and a
garrison of heavy infantry and other troops arrived accordingly. These
issuing from Spartolus were engaged by the Athenians in front of the
town: the Chalcidian heavy infantry, and some auxiliaries with them,
were beaten and retreated into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian horse and
light troops defeated the horse and light troops of the Athenians. The
Chalcidians had already a few targeteers from Crusis, and presently
after the battle were joined by some others from Olynthus; upon seeing
whom the light troops from Spartolus, emboldened by this accession and
by their previous success, with the help of the Chalcidian horse and
the reinforcement just arrived again attacked the Athenians, who
retired upon the two divisions which they had left with their baggage.
Whenever the Athenians advanced, their adversary gave way, pressing
them with missiles the instant they began to retire. The Chalcidian
horse also, riding up and charging them just as they pleased, at last
caused a panic amongst them and routed and pursued them to a great
distance. The Athenians took refuge in Potidæa, and afterwards
recovered their dead under truce, and returned to Athens with the
remnant of their army; four hundred and thirty men and all the generals
having fallen. The Chalcidians and Bottiaeans set up a trophy, took up
their dead, and dispersed to their several cities.

The same summer, not long after this, the Ambraciots and Chaonians,
being desirous of reducing the whole of Acarnania and detaching it from
Athens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from their
confederacy and send a thousand heavy infantry to Acarnania,
representing that, if a combined movement were made by land and sea,
the coast Acarnanians would be unable to march, and the conquest of
Zacynthus and Cephallenia easily following on the possession of
Acarnania, the cruise round Peloponnese would be no longer so
convenient for the Athenians. Besides which there was a hope of taking
Naupactus. The Lacedaemonians accordingly at once sent off a few
vessels with Cnemus, who was still high admiral, and the heavy infantry
on board; and sent round orders for the fleet to equip as quickly as
possible and sail to Leucas. The Corinthians were the most forward in
the business; the Ambraciots being a colony of theirs. While the ships
from Corinth, Sicyon, and the neighbourhood were getting ready, and
those from Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia, which had arrived before,
were waiting for them at Leucas, Cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry
had run into the gulf, giving the slip to Phormio, the commander of the
Athenian squadron stationed off Naupactus, and began at once to prepare
for the land expedition. The Hellenic troops with him consisted of the
Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians, and the thousand
Peloponnesians with whom he came; the barbarian of a thousand
Chaonians, who, belonging to a nation that has no king, were led by
Photys and Nicanor, the two members of the royal family to whom the
chieftainship for that year had been confided. With the Chaonians came
also some Thesprotians, like them without a king, some Molossians and
Atintanians led by Sabylinthus, the guardian of King Tharyps who was
still a minor, and some Paravaeans, under their king Oroedus,
accompanied by a thousand Orestians, subjects of King Antichus and
placed by him under the command of Oroedus. There were also a thousand
Macedonians sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge of the Athenians,
but they arrived too late. With this force Cnemus set out, without
waiting for the fleet from Corinth. Passing through the territory of
Amphilochian Argos, and sacking the open village of Limnaea, they
advanced to Stratus the Acarnanian capital; this once taken, the rest
of the country, they felt convinced, would speedily follow.

The Acarnanians, finding themselves invaded by a large army by land,
and from the sea threatened by a hostile fleet, made no combined
attempt at resistance, but remained to defend their homes, and sent for
help to Phormio, who replied that, when a fleet was on the point of
sailing from Corinth, it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus
unprotected. The Peloponnesians meanwhile and their allies advanced
upon Stratus in three divisions, with the intention of encamping near
it and attempting the wall by force if they failed to succeed by
negotiation. The order of march was as follows: the centre was occupied
by the Chaonians and the rest of the barbarians, with the Leucadians
and Anactorians and their followers on the right, and Cnemus with the
Peloponnesians and Ambraciots on the left; each division being a long
way off from, and sometimes even out of sight of, the others. The
Hellenes advanced in good order, keeping a look-out till they encamped
in a good position; but the Chaonians, filled with self-confidence, and
having the highest character for courage among the tribes of that part
of the continent, without waiting to occupy their camp, rushed on with
the rest of the barbarians, in the idea that they should take the town
by assault and obtain the sole glory of the enterprise. While they were
coming on, the Stratians, becoming aware how things stood, and thinking
that the defeat of this division would considerably dishearten the
Hellenes behind it, occupied the environs of the town with ambuscades,
and as soon as they approached engaged them at close quarters from the
city and the ambuscades. A panic seizing the Chaonians, great numbers
of them were slain; and as soon as they were seen to give way the rest
of the barbarians turned and fled. Owing to the distance by which their
allies had preceded them, neither of the Hellenic divisions knew
anything of the battle, but fancied they were hastening on to encamp.
However, when the flying barbarians broke in upon them, they opened
their ranks to receive them, brought their divisions together, and
stopped quiet where they were for the day; the Stratians not offering
to engage them, as the rest of the Acarnanians had not yet arrived, but
contenting themselves with slinging at them from a distance, which
distressed them greatly, as there was no stirring without their armour.
The Acarnanians would seem to excel in this mode of warfare.

As soon as night fell, Cnemus hastily drew off his army to the river
Anapus, about nine miles from Stratus, recovering his dead next day
under truce, and being there joined by the friendly Oeniadae, fell back
upon their city before the enemy’s reinforcements came up. From hence
each returned home; and the Stratians set up a trophy for the battle
with the barbarians.

Meanwhile the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates in
the Crissaean Gulf, which was to have co-operated with Cnemus and
prevented the coast Acarnanians from joining their countrymen in the
interior, was disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same
time as the battle at Stratus to fight with Phormio and the twenty
Athenian vessels stationed at Naupactus. For they were watched, as they
coasted along out of the gulf, by Phormio, who wished to attack in the
open sea. But the Corinthians and allies had started for Acarnania
without any idea of fighting at sea, and with vessels more like
transports for carrying soldiers; besides which, they never dreamed of
the twenty Athenian ships venturing to engage their forty-seven.
However, while they were coasting along their own shore, there were the
Athenians sailing along in line with them; and when they tried to cross
over from Patrae in Achaea to the mainland on the other side, on their
way to Acarnania, they saw them again coming out from Chalcis and the
river Evenus to meet them. They slipped from their moorings in the
night, but were observed, and were at length compelled to fight in mid
passage. Each state that contributed to the armament had its own
general; the Corinthian commanders were Machaon, Isocrates, and
Agatharchidas. The Peloponnesians ranged their vessels in as large a
circle as possible without leaving an opening, with the prows outside
and the sterns in; and placed within all the small craft in company,
and their five best sailers to issue out at a moment’s notice and
strengthen any point threatened by the enemy.

The Athenians, formed in line, sailed round and round them, and forced
them to contract their circle, by continually brushing past and making
as though they would attack at once, having been previously cautioned
by Phormio not to do so till he gave the signal. His hope was that the
Peloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore, but
that the ships would fall foul of one another and the small craft cause
confusion; and if the wind should blow from the gulf (in expectation of
which he kept sailing round them, and which usually rose towards
morning), they would not, he felt sure, remain steady an instant. He
also thought that it rested with him to attack when he pleased, as his
ships were better sailers, and that an attack timed by the coming of
the wind would tell best. When the wind came down, the enemy’s ships
were now in a narrow space, and what with the wind and the small craft
dashing against them, at once fell into confusion: ship fell foul of
ship, while the crews were pushing them off with poles, and by their
shouting, swearing, and struggling with one another, made captains’
orders and boatswains’ cries alike inaudible, and through being unable
for want of practice to clear their oars in the rough water, prevented
the vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly. At this moment
Phormio gave the signal, and the Athenians attacked. Sinking first one
of the admirals, they then disabled all they came across, so that no
one thought of resistance for the confusion, but fled for Patrae and
Dyme in Achaea. The Athenians gave chase and captured twelve ships, and
taking most of the men out of them sailed to Molycrium, and after
setting up a trophy on the promontory of Rhium and dedicating a ship to
Poseidon, returned to Naupactus. As for the Peloponnesians, they at
once sailed with their remaining ships along the coast from Dyme and
Patrae to Cyllene, the Eleian arsenal; where Cnemus, and the ships from
Leucas that were to have joined them, also arrived after the battle at
Stratus.

The Lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to Cnemus three
commissioners—Timocrates, Bradidas, and Lycophron—with orders to
prepare to engage again with better fortune, and not to be driven from
the sea by a few vessels; for they could not at all account for their
discomfiture, the less so as it was their first attempt at sea; and
they fancied that it was not that their marine was so inferior, but
that there had been misconduct somewhere, not considering the long
experience of the Athenians as compared with the little practice which
they had had themselves. The commissioners were accordingly sent in
anger. As soon as they arrived they set to work with Cnemus to order
ships from the different states, and to put those which they already
had in fighting order. Meanwhile Phormio sent word to Athens of their
preparations and his own victory, and desired as many ships as possible
to be speedily sent to him, as he stood in daily expectation of a
battle. Twenty were accordingly sent, but instructions were given to
their commander to go first to Crete. For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys,
who was proxenus of the Athenians, had persuaded them to sail against
Cydonia, promising to procure the reduction of that hostile town; his
real wish being to oblige the Polichnitans, neighbours of the
Cydonians. He accordingly went with the ships to Crete, and,
accompanied by the Polichnitans, laid waste the lands of the Cydonians;
and, what with adverse winds and stress of weather wasted no little
time there.

While the Athenians were thus detained in Crete, the Peloponnesians in
Cyllene got ready for battle, and coasted along to Panormus in Achaea,
where their land army had come to support them. Phormio also coasted
along to Molycrian Rhium, and anchored outside it with twenty ships,
the same as he had fought with before. This Rhium was friendly to the
Athenians. The other, in Peloponnese, lies opposite to it; the sea
between them is about three-quarters of a mile broad, and forms the
mouth of the Crissaean gulf. At this, the Achaean Rhium, not far off
Panormus, where their army lay, the Peloponnesians now cast anchor with
seventy-seven ships, when they saw the Athenians do so. For six or
seven days they remained opposite each other, practising and preparing
for the battle; the one resolved not to sail out of the Rhia into the
open sea, for fear of the disaster which had already happened to them,
the other not to sail into the straits, thinking it advantageous to the
enemy, to fight in the narrows. At last Cnemus and Brasidas and the
rest of the Peloponnesian commanders, being desirous of bringing on a
battle as soon as possible, before reinforcements should arrive from
Athens, and noticing that the men were most of them cowed by the
previous defeat and out of heart for the business, first called them
together and encouraged them as follows:

“Peloponnesians, the late engagement, which may have made some of you
afraid of the one now in prospect, really gives no just ground for
apprehension. Preparation for it, as you know, there was little enough;
and the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an
expedition by land. Besides this, the chances of war were largely
against us; and perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our
failure in our first naval action. It was not, therefore, cowardice
that produced our defeat, nor ought the determination which force has
not quelled, but which still has a word to say with its adversary, to
lose its edge from the result of an accident; but admitting the
possibility of a chance miscarriage, we should know that brave hearts
must be always brave, and while they remain so can never put forward
inexperience as an excuse for misconduct. Nor are you so behind the
enemy in experience as you are ahead of him in courage; and although
the science of your opponents would, if valour accompanied it, have
also the presence of mind to carry out at in emergency the lesson it
has learnt, yet a faint heart will make all art powerless in the face
of danger. For fear takes away presence of mind, and without valour art
is useless. Against their superior experience set your superior daring,
and against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been
then unprepared; remember, too, that you have always the advantage of
superior numbers, and of engaging off your own coast, supported by your
heavy infantry; and as a rule, numbers and equipment give victory. At
no point, therefore, is defeat likely; and as for our previous
mistakes, the very fact of their occurrence will teach us better for
the future. Steersmen and sailors may, therefore, confidently attend to
their several duties, none quitting the station assigned to them: as
for ourselves, we promise to prepare for the engagement at least as
well as your previous commanders, and to give no excuse for any one
misconducting himself. Should any insist on doing so, he shall meet
with the punishment he deserves, while the brave shall be honoured with
the appropriate rewards of valour.”

The Peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion.
Phormio, meanwhile, being himself not without fears for the courage of
his men, and noticing that they were forming in groups among themselves
and were alarmed at the odds against them, desired to call them
together and give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency.
He had before continually told them, and had accustomed their minds to
the idea, that there was no numerical superiority that they could not
face; and the men themselves had long been persuaded that Athenians
need never retire before any quantity of Peloponnesian vessels. At the
moment, however, he saw that they were dispirited by the sight before
them, and wishing to refresh their confidence, called them together and
spoke as follows:

“I see, my men, that you are frightened by the number of the enemy, and
I have accordingly called you together, not liking you to be afraid of
what is not really terrible. In the first place, the Peloponnesians,
already defeated, and not even themselves thinking that they are a
match for us, have not ventured to meet us on equal terms, but have
equipped this multitude of ships against us. Next, as to that upon
which they most rely, the courage which they suppose constitutional to
them, their confidence here only arises from the success which their
experience in land service usually gives them, and which they fancy
will do the same for them at sea. But this advantage will in all
justice belong to us on this element, if to them on that; as they are
not superior to us in courage, but we are each of us more confident,
according to our experience in our particular department. Besides, as
the Lacedaemonians use their supremacy over their allies to promote
their own glory, they are most of them being brought into danger
against their will, or they would never, after such a decided defeat,
have ventured upon a fresh engagement. You need not, therefore, be
afraid of their dash. You, on the contrary, inspire a much greater and
better founded alarm, both because of your late victory and also of
their belief that we should not face them unless about to do something
worthy of a success so signal. An adversary numerically superior, like
the one before us, comes into action trusting more to strength than to
resolution; while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must
have very great internal resources to draw upon. For these reasons the
Peloponnesians fear our irrational audacity more than they would ever
have done a more commensurate preparation. Besides, many armaments have
before now succumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes
of courage; neither of which defects certainly are ours. As to the
battle, it shall not be, if I can help it, in the strait, nor will I
sail in there at all; seeing that in a contest between a number of
clumsily managed vessels and a small, fast, well-handled squadron, want
of sea room is an undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run down an enemy
properly without having a sight of him a good way off, nor can one
retire at need when pressed; one can neither break the line nor return
upon his rear, the proper tactics for a fast sailer; but the naval
action necessarily becomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the
matter. For all this I will provide as far as can be. Do you stay at
your posts by your ships, and be sharp at catching the word of command,
the more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance;
and in action think order and silence all-important—qualities useful in
war generally, and in naval engagements in particular; and behave
before the enemy in a manner worthy of your past exploits. The issues
you will fight for are great—to destroy the naval hopes of the
Peloponnesians or to bring nearer to the Athenians their fears for the
sea. And I may once more remind you that you have defeated most of them
already; and beaten men do not face a danger twice with the same
determination.”

Such was the exhortation of Phormio. The Peloponnesians finding that
the Athenians did not sail into the gulf and the narrows, in order to
lead them in whether they wished it or not, put out at dawn, and
forming four abreast, sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their
own country, the right wing leading as they had lain at anchor. In this
wing were placed twenty of their best sailers; so that in the event of
Phormio thinking that their object was Naupactus, and coasting along
thither to save the place, the Athenians might not be able to escape
their onset by getting outside their wing, but might be cut off by the
vessels in question. As they expected, Phormio, in alarm for the place
at that moment emptied of its garrison, as soon as he saw them put out,
reluctantly and hurriedly embarked and sailed along shore; the
Messenian land forces moving along also to support him. The
Peloponnesians seeing him coasting along with his ships in single file,
and by this inside the gulf and close inshore as they so much wished,
at one signal tacked suddenly and bore down in line at their best speed
on the Athenians, hoping to cut off the whole squadron. The eleven
leading vessels, however, escaped the Peloponnesian wing and its sudden
movement, and reached the more open water; but the rest were overtaken
as they tried to run through, driven ashore and disabled; such of the
crews being slain as had not swum out of them. Some of the ships the
Peloponnesians lashed to their own, and towed off empty; one they took
with the men in it; others were just being towed off, when they were
saved by the Messenians dashing into the sea with their armour and
fighting from the decks that they had boarded.

Thus far victory was with the Peloponnesians, and the Athenian fleet
destroyed; the twenty ships in the right wing being meanwhile in chase
of the eleven Athenian vessels that had escaped their sudden movement
and reached the more open water. These, with the exception of one ship,
all outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus, and forming close
inshore opposite the temple of Apollo, with their prows facing the
enemy, prepared to defend themselves in case the Peloponnesians should
sail inshore against them. After a while the Peloponnesians came up,
chanting the paean for their victory as they sailed on; the single
Athenian ship remaining being chased by a Leucadian far ahead of the
rest. But there happened to be a merchantman lying at anchor in the
roadstead, which the Athenian ship found time to sail round, and struck
the Leucadian in chase amidships and sank her. An exploit so sudden and
unexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians; and having fallen
out of order in the excitement of victory, some of them dropped their
oars and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up—an
unsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy’s prows;
while others ran aground in the shallows, in their ignorance of the
localities.

Elated at this incident, the Athenians at one word gave a cheer, and
dashed at the enemy, who, embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder
in which he found himself, only stood for an instant, and then fled for
Panormus, whence he had put out. The Athenians following on his heels
took the six vessels nearest them, and recovered those of their own
which had been disabled close inshore and taken in tow at the beginning
of the action; they killed some of the crews and took some prisoners.
On board the Leucadian which went down off the merchantman, was the
Lacedaemonian Timocrates, who killed himself when the ship was sunk,
and was cast up in the harbour of Naupactus. The Athenians on their
return set up a trophy on the spot from which they had put out and
turned the day, and picking up the wrecks and dead that were on their
shore, gave back to the enemy their dead under truce. The
Peloponnesians also set up a trophy as victors for the defeat inflicted
upon the ships they had disabled in shore, and dedicated the vessel
which they had taken at Achaean Rhium, side by side with the trophy.
After this, apprehensive of the reinforcement expected from Athens, all
except the Leucadians sailed into the Crissaean Gulf for Corinth. Not
long after their retreat, the twenty Athenian ships, which were to have
joined Phormio before the battle, arrived at Naupactus.

Thus the summer ended. Winter was now at hand; but dispersing the
fleet, which had retired to Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf, Cnemus,
Brasidas, and the other Peloponnesian captains allowed themselves to be
persuaded by the Megarians to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of
Athens, which from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally
left unguarded and open. Their plan was as follows: The men were each
to take their oar, cushion, and rowlock thong, and, going overland from
Corinth to the sea on the Athenian side, to get to Megara as quickly as
they could, and launching forty vessels, which happened to be in the
docks at Nisaea, to sail at once to Piraeus. There was no fleet on the
look-out in the harbour, and no one had the least idea of the enemy
attempting a surprise; while an open attack would, it was thought,
never be deliberately ventured on, or, if in contemplation, would be
speedily known at Athens. Their plan formed, the next step was to put
it in execution. Arriving by night and launching the vessels from
Nisaea, they sailed, not to Piraeus as they had originally intended,
being afraid of the risk, besides which there was some talk of a wind
having stopped them, but to the point of Salamis that looks towards
Megara; where there was a fort and a squadron of three ships to prevent
anything sailing in or out of Megara. This fort they assaulted, and
towed off the galleys empty, and surprising the inhabitants began to
lay waste the rest of the island.

Meanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm Athens, and a panic ensued
there as serious as any that occurred during the war. The idea in the
city was that the enemy had already sailed into Piraeus: in Piraeus it
was thought that they had taken Salamis and might at any moment arrive
in the port; as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had
been a little firmer: certainly no wind would have prevented them. As
soon as day broke, the Athenians assembled in full force, launched
their ships, and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet to
Salamis, while their soldiery mounted guard in Piraeus. The
Peloponnesians, on becoming aware of the coming relief, after they had
overrun most of Salamis, hastily sailed off with their plunder and
captives and the three ships from Fort Budorum to Nisaea; the state of
their ships also causing them some anxiety, as it was a long while
since they had been launched, and they were not water-tight. Arrived at
Megara, they returned back on foot to Corinth. The Athenians finding
them no longer at Salamis, sailed back themselves; and after this made
arrangements for guarding Piraeus more diligently in future, by closing
the harbours, and by other suitable precautions.

About the same time, at the beginning of this winter, Sitalces, son of
Teres, the Odrysian king of Thrace, made an expedition against
Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of Macedonia, and the Chalcidians in
the neighbourhood of Thrace; his object being to enforce one promise
and fulfil another. On the one hand Perdiccas had made him a promise,
when hard pressed at the commencement of the war, upon condition that
Sitalces should reconcile the Athenians to him and not attempt to
restore his brother and enemy, the pretender Philip, but had not
offered to fulfil his engagement; on the other he, Sitalces, on
entering into alliance with the Athenians, had agreed to put an end to
the Chalcidian war in Thrace. These were the two objects of his
invasion. With him he brought Amyntas, the son of Philip, whom he
destined for the throne of Macedonia, and some Athenian envoys then at
his court on this business, and Hagnon as general; for the Athenians
were to join him against the Chalcidians with a fleet and as many
soldiers as they could get together.

Beginning with the Odrysians, he first called out the Thracian tribes
subject to him between Mounts Haemus and Rhodope and the Euxine and
Hellespont; next the Getae beyond Haemus, and the other hordes settled
south of the Danube in the neighbourhood of the Euxine, who, like the
Getae, border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being
all mounted archers. Besides these he summoned many of the hill
Thracian independent swordsmen, called Dii and mostly inhabiting Mount
Rhodope, some of whom came as mercenaries, others as volunteers; also
the Agrianes and Laeaeans, and the rest of the Paeonian tribes in his
empire, at the confines of which these lay, extending up to the Laeaean
Paeonians and the river Strymon, which flows from Mount Scombrus
through the country of the Agrianes and Laeaeans; there the empire of
Sitalces ends and the territory of the independent Paeonians begins.
Bordering on the Triballi, also independent, were the Treres and
Tilataeans, who dwell to the north of Mount Scombrus and extend towards
the setting sun as far as the river Oskius. This river rises in the
same mountains as the Nestus and Hebrus, a wild and extensive range
connected with Rhodope.

The empire of the Odrysians extended along the seaboard from Abdera to
the mouth of the Danube in the Euxine. The navigation of this coast by
the shortest route takes a merchantman four days and four nights with a
wind astern the whole way: by land an active man, travelling by the
shortest road, can get from Abdera to the Danube in eleven days. Such
was the length of its coast line. Inland from Byzantium to the Laeaeans
and the Strymon, the farthest limit of its extension into the interior,
it is a journey of thirteen days for an active man. The tribute from
all the barbarian districts and the Hellenic cities, taking what they
brought in under Seuthes, the successor of Sitalces, who raised it to
its greatest height, amounted to about four hundred talents in gold and
silver. There were also presents in gold and silver to a no less
amount, besides stuff, plain and embroidered, and other articles, made
not only for the king, but also for the Odrysian lords and nobles. For
there was here established a custom opposite to that prevailing in the
Persian kingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; more disgrace
being attached to not giving when asked than to asking and being
refused; and although this prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was
practised most extensively among the powerful Odrysians, it being
impossible to get anything done without a present. It was thus a very
powerful kingdom; in revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in
Europe between the Ionian Gulf and the Euxine, and in numbers and
military resources coming decidedly next to the Scythians, with whom
indeed no people in Europe can bear comparison, there not being even in
Asia any nation singly a match for them if unanimous, though of course
they are not on a level with other races in general intelligence and
the arts of civilized life.

It was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the field.
When everything was ready, he set out on his march for Macedonia, first
through his own dominions, next over the desolate range of Cercine that
divides the Sintians and Paeonians, crossing by a road which he had
made by felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter
people. Passing over these mountains, with the Paeonians on his right
and the Sintians and Maedians on the left, he finally arrived at
Doberus, in Paeonia, losing none of his army on the march, except
perhaps by sickness, but receiving some augmentations, many of the
independent Thracians volunteering to join him in the hope of plunder;
so that the whole is said to have formed a grand total of a hundred and
fifty thousand. Most of this was infantry, though there was about a
third cavalry, furnished principally by the Odrysians themselves and
next to them by the Getae. The most warlike of the infantry were the
independent swordsmen who came down from Rhodope; the rest of the mixed
multitude that followed him being chiefly formidable by their numbers.

Assembling in Doberus, they prepared for descending from the heights
upon Lower Macedonia, where the dominions of Perdiccas lay; for the
Lyncestae, Elimiots, and other tribes more inland, though Macedonians
by blood, and allies and dependants of their kindred, still have their
own separate governments. The country on the sea coast, now called
Macedonia, was first acquired by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas,
and his ancestors, originally Temenids from Argos. This was effected by
the expulsion from Pieria of the Pierians, who afterwards inhabited
Phagres and other places under Mount Pangaeus, beyond the Strymon
(indeed the country between Pangaeus and the sea is still called the
Pierian Gulf); of the Bottiaeans, at present neighbours of the
Chalcidians, from Bottia, and by the acquisition in Paeonia of a narrow
strip along the river Axius extending to Pella and the sea; the
district of Mygdonia, between the Axius and the Strymon, being also
added by the expulsion of the Edonians. From Eordia also were driven
the Eordians, most of whom perished, though a few of them still live
round Physca, and the Almopians from Almopia. These Macedonians also
conquered places belonging to the other tribes, which are still
theirs—Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, and much of Macedonia proper. The
whole is now called Macedonia, and at the time of the invasion of
Sitalces, Perdiccas, Alexander’s son, was the reigning king.

These Macedonians, unable to take the field against so numerous an
invader, shut themselves up in such strong places and fortresses as the
country possessed. Of these there was no great number, most of those
now found in the country having been erected subsequently by Archelaus,
the son of Perdiccas, on his accession, who also cut straight roads,
and otherwise put the kingdom on a better footing as regards horses,
heavy infantry, and other war material than had been done by all the
eight kings that preceded him. Advancing from Doberus, the Thracian
host first invaded what had been once Philip’s government, and took
Idomene by assault, Gortynia, Atalanta, and some other places by
negotiation, these last coming over for love of Philip’s son, Amyntas,
then with Sitalces. Laying siege to Europus, and failing to take it, he
next advanced into the rest of Macedonia to the left of Pella and
Cyrrhus, not proceeding beyond this into Bottiaea and Pieria, but
staying to lay waste Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Anthemus.

The Macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry; but
the Thracian host was, as opportunity offered, attacked by handfuls of
their horse, which had been reinforced from their allies in the
interior. Armed with cuirasses, and excellent horsemen, wherever these
charged they overthrew all before them, but ran considerable risk in
entangling themselves in the masses of the enemy, and so finally
desisted from these efforts, deciding that they were not strong enough
to venture against numbers so superior.

Meanwhile Sitalces opened negotiations with Perdiccas on the objects of
his expedition; and finding that the Athenians, not believing that he
would come, did not appear with their fleet, though they sent presents
and envoys, dispatched a large part of his army against the Chalcidians
and Bottiaeans, and shutting them up inside their walls laid waste
their country. While he remained in these parts, the people farther
south, such as the Thessalians, Magnetes, and the other tribes subject
to the Thessalians, and the Hellenes as far as Thermopylae, all feared
that the army might advance against them, and prepared accordingly.
These fears were shared by the Thracians beyond the Strymon to the
north, who inhabited the plains, such as the Panaeans, the Odomanti,
the Droi, and the Dersaeans, all of whom are independent. It was even
matter of conversation among the Hellenes who were enemies of Athens
whether he might not be invited by his ally to advance also against
them. Meanwhile he held Chalcidice and Bottice and Macedonia, and was
ravaging them all; but finding that he was not succeeding in any of the
objects of his invasion, and that his army was without provisions and
was suffering from the severity of the season, he listened to the
advice of Seuthes, son of Spardacus, his nephew and highest officer,
and decided to retreat without delay. This Seuthes had been secretly
gained by Perdiccas by the promise of his sister in marriage with a
rich dowry. In accordance with this advice, and after a stay of thirty
days in all, eight of which were spent in Chalcidice, he retired home
as quickly as he could; and Perdiccas afterwards gave his sister
Stratonice to Seuthes as he had promised. Such was the history of the
expedition of Sitalces.

In the course of this winter, after the dispersion of the Peloponnesian
fleet, the Athenians in Naupactus, under Phormio, coasted along to
Astacus and disembarked, and marched into the interior of Acarnania
with four hundred Athenian heavy infantry and four hundred Messenians.
After expelling some suspected persons from Stratus, Coronta, and other
places, and restoring Cynes, son of Theolytus, to Coronta, they
returned to their ships, deciding that it was impossible in the winter
season to march against Oeniadae, a place which, unlike the rest of
Acarnania, had been always hostile to them; for the river Achelous
flowing from Mount Pindus through Dolopia and the country of the
Agraeans and Amphilochians and the plain of Acarnania, past the town of
Stratus in the upper part of its course, forms lakes where it falls
into the sea round Oeniadae, and thus makes it impracticable for an
army in winter by reason of the water. Opposite to Oeniadae lie most of
the islands called Echinades, so close to the mouths of the Achelous
that that powerful stream is constantly forming deposits against them,
and has already joined some of the islands to the continent, and seems
likely in no long while to do the same with the rest. For the current
is strong, deep, and turbid, and the islands are so thick together that
they serve to imprison the alluvial deposit and prevent its dispersing,
lying, as they do, not in one line, but irregularly, so as to leave no
direct passage for the water into the open sea. The islands in question
are uninhabited and of no great size. There is also a story that
Alcmaeon, son of Amphiraus, during his wanderings after the murder of
his mother was bidden by Apollo to inhabit this spot, through an oracle
which intimated that he would have no release from his terrors until he
should find a country to dwell in which had not been seen by the sun,
or existed as land at the time he slew his mother; all else being to
him polluted ground. Perplexed at this, the story goes on to say, he at
last observed this deposit of the Achelous, and considered that a place
sufficient to support life upon, might have been thrown up during the
long interval that had elapsed since the death of his mother and the
beginning of his wanderings. Settling, therefore, in the district round
Oeniadae, he founded a dominion, and left the country its name from his
son Acarnan. Such is the story we have received concerning Alcmaeon.

The Athenians and Phormio putting back from Acarnania and arriving at
Naupactus, sailed home to Athens in the spring, taking with them the
ships that they had captured, and such of the prisoners made in the
late actions as were freemen; who were exchanged, man for man. And so
ended this winter, and the third year of this war, of which Thucydides
was the historian.

CHAPTER IX


Fourth and Fifth Years of the War—Revolt of Mitylene


The next summer, just as the corn was getting ripe, the Peloponnesians
and their allies invaded Attica under the command of Archidamus, son of
Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and ravaged the
land; the Athenian horse as usual attacking them, wherever it was
practicable, and preventing the mass of the light troops from advancing
from their camp and wasting the parts near the city. After staying the
time for which they had taken provisions, the invaders retired and
dispersed to their several cities.

Immediately after the invasion of the Peloponnesians all Lesbos, except
Methymna, revolted from the Athenians. The Lesbians had wished to
revolt even before the war, but the Lacedaemonians would not receive
them; and yet now when they did revolt, they were compelled to do so
sooner than they had intended. While they were waiting until the moles
for their harbours and the ships and walls that they had in building
should be finished, and for the arrival of archers and corn and other
things that they were engaged in fetching from the Pontus, the
Tenedians, with whom they were at enmity, and the Methymnians, and some
factious persons in Mitylene itself, who were proxeni of Athens,
informed the Athenians that the Mitylenians were forcibly uniting the
island under their sovereignty, and that the preparations about which
they were so active, were all concerted with the Boeotians their
kindred and the Lacedaemonians with a view to a revolt, and that,
unless they were immediately prevented, Athens would lose Lesbos.

However, the Athenians, distressed by the plague, and by the war that
had recently broken out and was now raging, thought it a serious matter
to add Lesbos with its fleet and untouched resources to the list of
their enemies; and at first would not believe the charge, giving too
much weight to their wish that it might not be true. But when an
embassy which they sent had failed to persuade the Mitylenians to give
up the union and preparations complained of, they became alarmed, and
resolved to strike the first blow. They accordingly suddenly sent off
forty ships that had been got ready to sail round Peloponnese, under
the command of Cleippides, son of Deinias, and two others; word having
been brought them of a festival in honour of the Malean Apollo outside
the town, which is kept by the whole people of Mitylene, and at which,
if haste were made, they might hope to take them by surprise. If this
plan succeeded, well and good; if not, they were to order the
Mitylenians to deliver up their ships and to pull down their walls, and
if they did not obey, to declare war. The ships accordingly set out;
the ten galleys, forming the contingent of the Mitylenians present with
the fleet according to the terms of the alliance, being detained by the
Athenians, and their crews placed in custody. However, the Mitylenians
were informed of the expedition by a man who crossed from Athens to
Euboea, and going overland to Geraestus, sailed from thence by a
merchantman which he found on the point of putting to sea, and so
arrived at Mitylene the third day after leaving Athens. The Mitylenians
accordingly refrained from going out to the temple at Malea, and
moreover barricaded and kept guard round the half-finished parts of
their walls and harbours.

When the Athenians sailed in not long after and saw how things stood,
the generals delivered their orders, and upon the Mitylenians refusing
to obey, commenced hostilities. The Mitylenians, thus compelled to go
to war without notice and unprepared, at first sailed out with their
fleet and made some show of fighting, a little in front of the harbour;
but being driven back by the Athenian ships, immediately offered to
treat with the commanders, wishing, if possible, to get the ships away
for the present upon any tolerable terms. The Athenian commanders
accepted their offers, being themselves fearful that they might not be
able to cope with the whole of Lesbos; and an armistice having been
concluded, the Mitylenians sent to Athens one of the informers, already
repentant of his conduct, and others with him, to try to persuade the
Athenians of the innocence of their intentions and to get the fleet
recalled. In the meantime, having no great hope of a favourable answer
from Athens, they also sent off a galley with envoys to Lacedaemon,
unobserved by the Athenian fleet which was anchored at Malea to the
north of the town.

While these envoys, reaching Lacedaemon after a difficult journey
across the open sea, were negotiating for succours being sent them, the
ambassadors from Athens returned without having effected anything; and
hostilities were at once begun by the Mitylenians and the rest of
Lesbos, with the exception of the Methymnians, who came to the aid of
the Athenians with the Imbrians and Lemnians and some few of the other
allies. The Mitylenians made a sortie with all their forces against the
Athenian camp; and a battle ensued, in which they gained some slight
advantage, but retired notwithstanding, not feeling sufficient
confidence in themselves to spend the night upon the field. After this
they kept quiet, wishing to wait for the chance of reinforcements
arriving from Peloponnese before making a second venture, being
encouraged by the arrival of Meleas, a Laconian, and Hermaeondas, a
Theban, who had been sent off before the insurrection but had been
unable to reach Lesbos before the Athenian expedition, and who now
stole in in a galley after the battle, and advised them to send another
galley and envoys back with them, which the Mitylenians accordingly
did.

Meanwhile the Athenians, greatly encouraged by the inaction of the
Mitylenians, summoned allies to their aid, who came in all the quicker
from seeing so little vigour displayed by the Lesbians, and bringing
round their ships to a new station to the south of the town, fortified
two camps, one on each side of the city, and instituted a blockade of
both the harbours. The sea was thus closed against the Mitylenians,
who, however, commanded the whole country, with the rest of the
Lesbians who had now joined them; the Athenians only holding a limited
area round their camps, and using Malea more as the station for their
ships and their market.

While the war went on in this way at Mitylene, the Athenians, about the
same time in this summer, also sent thirty ships to Peloponnese under
Asopius, son of Phormio; the Acarnanians insisting that the commander
sent should be some son or relative of Phormio. As the ships coasted
along shore they ravaged the seaboard of Laconia; after which Asopius
sent most of the fleet home, and himself went on with twelve vessels to
Naupactus, and afterwards raising the whole Acarnanian population made
an expedition against Oeniadae, the fleet sailing along the Achelous,
while the army laid waste the country. The inhabitants, however,
showing no signs of submitting, he dismissed the land forces and
himself sailed to Leucas, and making a descent upon Nericus was cut off
during his retreat, and most of his troops with him, by the people in
those parts aided by some coastguards; after which the Athenians sailed
away, recovering their dead from the Leucadians under truce.

Meanwhile the envoys of the Mitylenians sent out in the first ship were
told by the Lacedaemonians to come to Olympia, in order that the rest
of the allies might hear them and decide upon their matter, and so they
journeyed thither. It was the Olympiad in which the Rhodian Dorieus
gained his second victory, and the envoys having been introduced to
make their speech after the festival, spoke as follows:

“Lacedaemonians and allies, the rule established among the Hellenes is
not unknown to us. Those who revolt in war and forsake their former
confederacy are favourably regarded by those who receive them, in so
far as they are of use to them, but otherwise are thought less well of,
through being considered traitors to their former friends. Nor is this
an unfair way of judging, where the rebels and the power from whom they
secede are at one in policy and sympathy, and a match for each other in
resources and power, and where no reasonable ground exists for the
rebellion. But with us and the Athenians this was not the case; and no
one need think the worse of us for revolting from them in danger, after
having been honoured by them in time of peace.

“Justice and honesty will be the first topics of our speech, especially
as we are asking for alliance; because we know that there can never be
any solid friendship between individuals, or union between communities
that is worth the name, unless the parties be persuaded of each other’s
honesty, and be generally congenial the one to the other; since from
difference in feeling springs also difference in conduct. Between
ourselves and the Athenians alliance began, when you withdrew from the
Median War and they remained to finish the business. But we did not
become allies of the Athenians for the subjugation of the Hellenes, but
allies of the Hellenes for their liberation from the Mede; and as long
as the Athenians led us fairly we followed them loyally; but when we
saw them relax their hostility to the Mede, to try to compass the
subjection of the allies, then our apprehensions began. Unable,
however, to unite and defend themselves, on account of the number of
confederates that had votes, all the allies were enslaved, except
ourselves and the Chians, who continued to send our contingents as
independent and nominally free. Trust in Athens as a leader, however,
we could no longer feel, judging by the examples already given; it
being unlikely that she would reduce our fellow confederates, and not
do the same by us who were left, if ever she had the power.

“Had we all been still independent, we could have had more faith in
their not attempting any change; but the greater number being their
subjects, while they were treating us as equals, they would naturally
chafe under this solitary instance of independence as contrasted with
the submission of the majority; particularly as they daily grew more
powerful, and we more destitute. Now the only sure basis of an alliance
is for each party to be equally afraid of the other; he who would like
to encroach is then deterred by the reflection that he will not have
odds in his favour. Again, if we were left independent, it was only
because they thought they saw their way to empire more clearly by
specious language and by the paths of policy than by those of force.
Not only were we useful as evidence that powers who had votes, like
themselves, would not, surely, join them in their expeditions, against
their will, without the party attacked being in the wrong; but the same
system also enabled them to lead the stronger states against the weaker
first, and so to leave the former to the last, stripped of their
natural allies, and less capable of resistance. But if they had begun
with us, while all the states still had their resources under their own
control, and there was a centre to rally round, the work of subjugation
would have been found less easy. Besides this, our navy gave them some
apprehension: it was always possible that it might unite with you or
with some other power, and become dangerous to Athens. The court which
we paid to their commons and its leaders for the time being also helped
us to maintain our independence. However, we did not expect to be able
to do so much longer, if this war had not broken out, from the examples
that we had had of their conduct to the rest.

“How then could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom as we
had here? We accepted each other against our inclination; fear made
them court us in war, and us them in peace; sympathy, the ordinary
basis of confidence, had its place supplied by terror, fear having more
share than friendship in detaining us in the alliance; and the first
party that should be encouraged by the hope of impunity was certain to
break faith with the other. So that to condemn us for being the first
to break off, because they delay the blow that we dread, instead of
ourselves delaying to know for certain whether it will be dealt or not,
is to take a false view of the case. For if we were equally able with
them to meet their plots and imitate their delay, we should be their
equals and should be under no necessity of being their subjects; but
the liberty of offence being always theirs, that of defence ought
clearly to be ours.

“Such, Lacedaemonians and allies, are the grounds and the reasons of
our revolt; clear enough to convince our hearers of the fairness of our
conduct, and sufficient to alarm ourselves, and to make us turn to some
means of safety. This we wished to do long ago, when we sent to you on
the subject while the peace yet lasted, but were balked by your
refusing to receive us; and now, upon the Boeotians inviting us, we at
once responded to the call, and decided upon a twofold revolt, from the
Hellenes and from the Athenians, not to aid the latter in harming the
former, but to join in their liberation, and not to allow the Athenians
in the end to destroy us, but to act in time against them. Our revolt,
however, has taken place prematurely and without preparation—a fact
which makes it all the more incumbent on you to receive us into
alliance and to send us speedy relief, in order to show that you
support your friends, and at the same time do harm to your enemies. You
have an opportunity such as you never had before. Disease and
expenditure have wasted the Athenians: their ships are either cruising
round your coasts, or engaged in blockading us; and it is not probable
that they will have any to spare, if you invade them a second time this
summer by sea and land; but they will either offer no resistance to
your vessels, or withdraw from both our shores. Nor must it be thought
that this is a case of putting yourselves into danger for a country
which is not yours. Lesbos may appear far off, but when help is wanted
she will be found near enough. It is not in Attica that the war will be
decided, as some imagine, but in the countries by which Attica is
supported; and the Athenian revenue is drawn from the allies, and will
become still larger if they reduce us; as not only will no other state
revolt, but our resources will be added to theirs, and we shall be
treated worse than those that were enslaved before. But if you will
frankly support us, you will add to your side a state that has a large
navy, which is your great want; you will smooth the way to the
overthrow of the Athenians by depriving them of their allies, who will
be greatly encouraged to come over; and you will free yourselves from
the imputation made against you, of not supporting insurrection. In
short, only show yourselves as liberators, and you may count upon
having the advantage in the war.

“Respect, therefore, the hopes placed in you by the Hellenes, and that
Olympian Zeus, in whose temple we stand as very suppliants; become the
allies and defenders of the Mitylenians, and do not sacrifice us, who
put our lives upon the hazard, in a cause in which general good will
result to all from our success, and still more general harm if we fail
through your refusing to help us; but be the men that the Hellenes
think you, and our fears desire.”

Such were the words of the Mitylenians. After hearing them out, the
Lacedaemonians and confederates granted what they urged, and took the
Lesbians into alliance, and deciding in favour of the invasion of
Attica, told the allies present to march as quickly as possible to the
Isthmus with two-thirds of their forces; and arriving there first
themselves, got ready hauling machines to carry their ships across from
Corinth to the sea on the side of Athens, in order to make their attack
by sea and land at once. However, the zeal which they displayed was not
imitated by the rest of the confederates, who came in but slowly, being
engaged in harvesting their corn and sick of making expeditions.

Meanwhile the Athenians, aware that the preparations of the enemy were
due to his conviction of their weakness, and wishing to show him that
he was mistaken, and that they were able, without moving the Lesbian
fleet, to repel with ease that with which they were menaced from
Peloponnese, manned a hundred ships by embarking the citizens of
Athens, except the knights and Pentacosiomedimni, and the resident
aliens; and putting out to the Isthmus, displayed their power, and made
descents upon Peloponnese wherever they pleased. A disappointment so
signal made the Lacedaemonians think that the Lesbians had not spoken
the truth; and embarrassed by the non-appearance of the confederates,
coupled with the news that the thirty ships round Peloponnese were
ravaging the lands near Sparta, they went back home. Afterwards,
however, they got ready a fleet to send to Lesbos, and ordering a total
of forty ships from the different cities in the league, appointed
Alcidas to command the expedition in his capacity of high admiral.
Meanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships, upon seeing the
Lacedaemonians go home, went home likewise.

If, at the time that this fleet was at sea, Athens had almost the
largest number of first-rate ships in commission that she ever
possessed at any one moment, she had as many or even more when the war
began. At that time one hundred guarded Attica, Euboea, and Salamis; a
hundred more were cruising round Peloponnese, besides those employed at
Potidæa and in other places; making a grand total of two hundred and
fifty vessels employed on active service in a single summer. It was
this, with Potidæa, that most exhausted her revenues—Potidæa being
blockaded by a force of heavy infantry (each drawing two drachmae a
day, one for himself and another for his servant), which amounted to
three thousand at first, and was kept at this number down to the end of
the siege; besides sixteen hundred with Phormio who went away before it
was over; and the ships being all paid at the same rate. In this way
her money was wasted at first; and this was the largest number of ships
ever manned by her.

About the same time that the Lacedaemonians were at the Isthmus, the
Mitylenians marched by land with their mercenaries against Methymna,
which they thought to gain by treachery. After assaulting the town, and
not meeting with the success that they anticipated, they withdrew to
Antissa, Pyrrha, and Eresus; and taking measures for the better
security of these towns and strengthening their walls, hastily returned
home. After their departure the Methymnians marched against Antissa,
but were defeated in a sortie by the Antissians and their mercenaries,
and retreated in haste after losing many of their number. Word of this
reaching Athens, and the Athenians learning that the Mitylenians were
masters of the country and their own soldiers unable to hold them in
check, they sent out about the beginning of autumn Paches, son of
Epicurus, to take the command, and a thousand Athenian heavy infantry;
who worked their own passage and, arriving at Mitylene, built a single
wall all round it, forts being erected at some of the strongest points.
Mitylene was thus blockaded strictly on both sides, by land and by sea;
and winter now drew near.

The Athenians needing money for the siege, although they had for the
first time raised a contribution of two hundred talents from their own
citizens, now sent out twelve ships to levy subsidies from their
allies, with Lysicles and four others in command. After cruising to
different places and laying them under contribution, Lysicles went up
the country from Myus, in Caria, across the plain of the Meander, as
far as the hill of Sandius; and being attacked by the Carians and the
people of Anaia, was slain with many of his soldiers.

The same winter the Plataeans, who were still being besieged by the
Peloponnesians and Boeotians, distressed by the failure of their
provisions, and seeing no hope of relief from Athens, nor any other
means of safety, formed a scheme with the Athenians besieged with them
for escaping, if possible, by forcing their way over the enemy’s walls;
the attempt having been suggested by Theaenetus, son of Tolmides, a
soothsayer, and Eupompides, son of Daimachus, one of their generals. At
first all were to join: afterwards, half hung back, thinking the risk
great; about two hundred and twenty, however, voluntarily persevered in
the attempt, which was carried out in the following way. Ladders were
made to match the height of the enemy’s wall, which they measured by
the layers of bricks, the side turned towards them not being thoroughly
whitewashed. These were counted by many persons at once; and though
some might miss the right calculation, most would hit upon it,
particularly as they counted over and over again, and were no great way
from the wall, but could see it easily enough for their purpose. The
length required for the ladders was thus obtained, being calculated
from the breadth of the brick.

Now the wall of the Peloponnesians was constructed as follows. It
consisted of two lines drawn round the place, one against the
Plataeans, the other against any attack on the outside from Athens,
about sixteen feet apart. The intermediate space of sixteen feet was
occupied by huts portioned out among the soldiers on guard, and built
in one block, so as to give the appearance of a single thick wall with
battlements on either side. At intervals of every ten battlements were
towers of considerable size, and the same breadth as the wall, reaching
right across from its inner to its outer face, with no means of passing
except through the middle. Accordingly on stormy and wet nights the
battlements were deserted, and guard kept from the towers, which were
not far apart and roofed in above.

Such being the structure of the wall by which the Plataeans were
blockaded, when their preparations were completed, they waited for a
stormy night of wind and rain and without any moon, and then set out,
guided by the authors of the enterprise. Crossing first the ditch that
ran round the town, they next gained the wall of the enemy unperceived
by the sentinels, who did not see them in the darkness, or hear them,
as the wind drowned with its roar the noise of their approach; besides
which they kept a good way off from each other, that they might not be
betrayed by the clash of their weapons. They were also lightly
equipped, and had only the left foot shod to preserve them from
slipping in the mire. They came up to the battlements at one of the
intermediate spaces where they knew them to be unguarded: those who
carried the ladders went first and planted them; next twelve
light-armed soldiers with only a dagger and a breastplate mounted, led
by Ammias, son of Coroebus, who was the first on the wall; his
followers getting up after him and going six to each of the towers.
After these came another party of light troops armed with spears, whose
shields, that they might advance the easier, were carried by men
behind, who were to hand them to them when they found themselves in
presence of the enemy. After a good many had mounted they were
discovered by the sentinels in the towers, by the noise made by a tile
which was knocked down by one of the Plataeans as he was laying hold of
the battlements. The alarm was instantly given, and the troops rushed
to the wall, not knowing the nature of the danger, owing to the dark
night and stormy weather; the Plataeans in the town having also chosen
that moment to make a sortie against the wall of the Peloponnesians
upon the side opposite to that on which their men were getting over, in
order to divert the attention of the besiegers. Accordingly they
remained distracted at their several posts, without any venturing to
stir to give help from his own station, and at a loss to guess what was
going on. Meanwhile the three hundred set aside for service on
emergencies went outside the wall in the direction of the alarm.
Fire-signals of an attack were also raised towards Thebes; but the
Plataeans in the town at once displayed a number of others, prepared
beforehand for this very purpose, in order to render the enemy’s
signals unintelligible, and to prevent his friends getting a true idea
of what was passing and coming to his aid before their comrades who had
gone out should have made good their escape and be in safety.

Meanwhile the first of the scaling party that had got up, after
carrying both the towers and putting the sentinels to the sword, posted
themselves inside to prevent any one coming through against them; and
rearing ladders from the wall, sent several men up on the towers, and
from their summit and base kept in check all of the enemy that came up,
with their missiles, while their main body planted a number of ladders
against the wall, and knocking down the battlements, passed over
between the towers; each as soon as he had got over taking up his
station at the edge of the ditch, and plying from thence with arrows
and darts any who came along the wall to stop the passage of his
comrades. When all were over, the party on the towers came down, the
last of them not without difficulty, and proceeded to the ditch, just
as the three hundred came up carrying torches. The Plataeans, standing
on the edge of the ditch in the dark, had a good view of their
opponents, and discharged their arrows and darts upon the unarmed parts
of their bodies, while they themselves could not be so well seen in the
obscurity for the torches; and thus even the last of them got over the
ditch, though not without effort and difficulty; as ice had formed in
it, not strong enough to walk upon, but of that watery kind which
generally comes with a wind more east than north, and the snow which
this wind had caused to fall during the night had made the water in the
ditch rise, so that they could scarcely breast it as they crossed.
However, it was mainly the violence of the storm that enabled them to
effect their escape at all.

Starting from the ditch, the Plataeans went all together along the road
leading to Thebes, keeping the chapel of the hero Androcrates upon
their right; considering that the last road which the Peloponnesians
would suspect them of having taken would be that towards their enemies’
country. Indeed they could see them pursuing with torches upon the
Athens road towards Cithaeron and Druoskephalai or Oakheads. After
going for rather more than half a mile upon the road to Thebes, the
Plataeans turned off and took that leading to the mountain, to Erythrae
and Hysiae, and reaching the hills, made good their escape to Athens,
two hundred and twelve men in all; some of their number having turned
back into the town before getting over the wall, and one archer having
been taken prisoner at the outer ditch. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians
gave up the pursuit and returned to their posts; and the Plataeans in
the town, knowing nothing of what had passed, and informed by those who
had turned back that not a man had escaped, sent out a herald as soon
as it was day to make a truce for the recovery of the dead bodies, and
then, learning the truth, desisted. In this way the Plataean party got
over and were saved.

Towards the close of the same winter, Salaethus, a Lacedaemonian, was
sent out in a galley from Lacedaemon to Mitylene. Going by sea to
Pyrrha, and from thence overland, he passed along the bed of a torrent,
where the line of circumvallation was passable, and thus entering
unperceived into Mitylene told the magistrates that Attica would
certainly be invaded, and the forty ships destined to relieve them
arrive, and that he had been sent on to announce this and to
superintend matters generally. The Mitylenians upon this took courage,
and laid aside the idea of treating with the Athenians; and now this
winter ended, and with it ended the fourth year of the war of which
Thucydides was the historian.

The next summer the Peloponnesians sent off the forty-two ships for
Mitylene, under Alcidas, their high admiral, and themselves and their
allies invaded Attica, their object being to distract the Athenians by
a double movement, and thus to make it less easy for them to act
against the fleet sailing to Mitylene. The commander in this invasion
was Cleomenes, in the place of King Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax, his
nephew, who was still a minor. Not content with laying waste whatever
had shot up in the parts which they had before devastated, the invaders
now extended their ravages to lands passed over in their previous
incursions; so that this invasion was more severely felt by the
Athenians than any except the second; the enemy staying on and on until
they had overrun most of the country, in the expectation of hearing
from Lesbos of something having been achieved by their fleet, which
they thought must now have got over. However, as they did not obtain
any of the results expected, and their provisions began to run short,
they retreated and dispersed to their different cities.

In the meantime the Mitylenians, finding their provisions failing,
while the fleet from Peloponnese was loitering on the way instead of
appearing at Mitylene, were compelled to come to terms with the
Athenians in the following manner. Salaethus having himself ceased to
expect the fleet to arrive, now armed the commons with heavy armour,
which they had not before possessed, with the intention of making a
sortie against the Athenians. The commons, however, no sooner found
themselves possessed of arms than they refused any longer to obey their
officers; and forming in knots together, told the authorities to bring
out in public the provisions and divide them amongst them all, or they
would themselves come to terms with the Athenians and deliver up the
city.

The government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of the
danger they would be in, if left out of the capitulation, publicly
agreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion and
to admit the troops into the town; upon the understanding that the
Mitylenians should be allowed to send an embassy to Athens to plead
their cause, and that Paches should not imprison, make slaves of, or
put to death any of the citizens until its return. Such were the terms
of the capitulation; in spite of which the chief authors of the
negotiation with Lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when
the army entered that they went and seated themselves by the altars,
from which they were raised up by Paches under promise that he would do
them no wrong, and lodged by him in Tenedos, until he should learn the
pleasure of the Athenians concerning them. Paches also sent some
galleys and seized Antissa, and took such other military measures as he
thought advisable.

Meanwhile the Peloponnesians in the forty ships, who ought to have made
all haste to relieve Mitylene, lost time in coming round Peloponnese
itself, and proceeding leisurely on the remainder of the voyage, made
Delos without having been seen by the Athenians at Athens, and from
thence arriving at Icarus and Myconus, there first heard of the fall of
Mitylene. Wishing to know the truth, they put into Embatum, in the
Erythraeid, about seven days after the capture of the town. Here they
learned the truth, and began to consider what they were to do; and
Teutiaplus, an Elean, addressed them as follows:

“Alcidas and Peloponnesians who share with me the command of this
armament, my advice is to sail just as we are to Mitylene, before we
have been heard of. We may expect to find the Athenians as much off
their guard as men generally are who have just taken a city: this will
certainly be so by sea, where they have no idea of any enemy attacking
them, and where our strength, as it happens, mainly lies; while even
their land forces are probably scattered about the houses in the
carelessness of victory. If therefore we were to fall upon them
suddenly and in the night, I have hopes, with the help of the
well-wishers that we may have left inside the town, that we shall
become masters of the place. Let us not shrink from the risk, but let
us remember that this is just the occasion for one of the baseless
panics common in war: and that to be able to guard against these in
one’s own case, and to detect the moment when an attack will find an
enemy at this disadvantage, is what makes a successful general.”

These words of Teutiaplus failing to move Alcidas, some of the Ionian
exiles and the Lesbians with the expedition began to urge him, since
this seemed too dangerous, to seize one of the Ionian cities or the
Aeolic town of Cyme, to use as a base for effecting the revolt of
Ionia. This was by no means a hopeless enterprise, as their coming was
welcome everywhere; their object would be by this move to deprive
Athens of her chief source of revenue, and at the same time to saddle
her with expense, if she chose to blockade them; and they would
probably induce Pissuthnes to join them in the war. However, Alcidas
gave this proposal as bad a reception as the other, being eager, since
he had come too late for Mitylene, to find himself back in Peloponnese
as soon as possible.

Accordingly he put out from Embatum and proceeded along shore; and
touching at the Teian town, Myonnesus, there butchered most of the
prisoners that he had taken on his passage. Upon his coming to anchor
at Ephesus, envoys came to him from the Samians at Anaia, and told him
that he was not going the right way to free Hellas in massacring men
who had never raised a hand against him, and who were not enemies of
his, but allies of Athens against their will, and that if he did not
stop he would turn many more friends into enemies than enemies into
friends. Alcidas agreed to this, and let go all the Chians still in his
hands and some of the others that he had taken; the inhabitants,
instead of flying at the sight of his vessels, rather coming up to
them, taking them for Athenian, having no sort of expectation that
while the Athenians commanded the sea Peloponnesian ships would venture
over to Ionia.

From Ephesus Alcidas set sail in haste and fled. He had been seen by
the Salaminian and Paralian galleys, which happened to be sailing from
Athens, while still at anchor off Clarus; and fearing pursuit he now
made across the open sea, fully determined to touch nowhere, if he
could help it, until he got to Peloponnese. Meanwhile news of him had
come in to Paches from the Erythraeid, and indeed from all quarters. As
Ionia was unfortified, great fears were felt that the Peloponnesians
coasting along shore, even if they did not intend to stay, might make
descents in passing and plunder the towns; and now the Paralian and
Salaminian, having seen him at Clarus, themselves brought intelligence
of the fact. Paches accordingly gave hot chase, and continued the
pursuit as far as the isle of Patmos, and then finding that Alcidas had
got on too far to be overtaken, came back again. Meanwhile he thought
it fortunate that, as he had not fallen in with them out at sea, he had
not overtaken them anywhere where they would have been forced to
encamp, and so give him the trouble of blockading them.

On his return along shore he touched, among other places, at Notium,
the port of Colophon, where the Colophonians had settled after the
capture of the upper town by Itamenes and the barbarians, who had been
called in by certain individuals in a party quarrel. The capture of the
town took place about the time of the second Peloponnesian invasion of
Attica. However, the refugees, after settling at Notium, again split up
into factions, one of which called in Arcadian and barbarian
mercenaries from Pissuthnes and, entrenching these in a quarter apart,
formed a new community with the Median party of the Colophonians who
joined them from the upper town. Their opponents had retired into
exile, and now called in Paches, who invited Hippias, the commander of
the Arcadians in the fortified quarter, to a parley, upon condition
that, if they could not agree, he was to be put back safe and sound in
the fortification. However, upon his coming out to him, he put him into
custody, though not in chains, and attacked suddenly and took by
surprise the fortification, and putting the Arcadians and the
barbarians found in it to the sword, afterwards took Hippias into it as
he had promised, and, as soon as he was inside, seized him and shot him
down. Paches then gave up Notium to the Colophonians not of the Median
party; and settlers were afterwards sent out from Athens, and the place
colonized according to Athenian laws, after collecting all the
Colophonians found in any of the cities.

Arrived at Mitylene, Paches reduced Pyrrha and Eresus; and finding the
Lacedaemonian, Salaethus, in hiding in the town, sent him off to
Athens, together with the Mitylenians that he had placed in Tenedos,
and any other persons that he thought concerned in the revolt. He also
sent back the greater part of his forces, remaining with the rest to
settle Mitylene and the rest of Lesbos as he thought best.

Upon the arrival of the prisoners with Salaethus, the Athenians at once
put the latter to death, although he offered, among other things, to
procure the withdrawal of the Peloponnesians from Plataea, which was
still under siege; and after deliberating as to what they should do
with the former, in the fury of the moment determined to put to death
not only the prisoners at Athens, but the whole adult male population
of Mitylene, and to make slaves of the women and children. It was
remarked that Mitylene had revolted without being, like the rest,
subjected to the empire; and what above all swelled the wrath of the
Athenians was the fact of the Peloponnesian fleet having ventured over
to Ionia to her support, a fact which was held to argue a long
meditated rebellion. They accordingly sent a galley to communicate the
decree to Paches, commanding him to lose no time in dispatching the
Mitylenians. The morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on
the horrid cruelty of a decree, which condemned a whole city to the
fate merited only by the guilty. This was no sooner perceived by the
Mitylenian ambassadors at Athens and their Athenian supporters, than
they moved the authorities to put the question again to the vote; which
they the more easily consented to do, as they themselves plainly saw
that most of the citizens wished some one to give them an opportunity
for reconsidering the matter. An assembly was therefore at once called,
and after much expression of opinion upon both sides, Cleon, son of
Cleaenetus, the same who had carried the former motion of putting the
Mitylenians to death, the most violent man at Athens, and at that time
by far the most powerful with the commons, came forward again and spoke
as follows:

“I have often before now been convinced that a democracy is incapable
of empire, and never more so than by your present change of mind in the
matter of Mitylene. Fears or plots being unknown to you in your daily
relations with each other, you feel just the same with regard to your
allies, and never reflect that the mistakes into which you may be led
by listening to their appeals, or by giving way to your own compassion,
are full of danger to yourselves, and bring you no thanks for your
weakness from your allies; entirely forgetting that your empire is a
despotism and your subjects disaffected conspirators, whose obedience
is ensured not by your suicidal concessions, but by the superiority
given you by your own strength and not their loyalty. The most alarming
feature in the case is the constant change of measures with which we
appear to be threatened, and our seeming ignorance of the fact that bad
laws which are never changed are better for a city than good ones that
have no authority; that unlearned loyalty is more serviceable than
quick-witted insubordination; and that ordinary men usually manage
public affairs better than their more gifted fellows. The latter are
always wanting to appear wiser than the laws, and to overrule every
proposition brought forward, thinking that they cannot show their wit
in more important matters, and by such behaviour too often ruin their
country; while those who mistrust their own cleverness are content to
be less learned than the laws, and less able to pick holes in the
speech of a good speaker; and being fair judges rather than rival
athletes, generally conduct affairs successfully. These we ought to
imitate, instead of being led on by cleverness and intellectual rivalry
to advise your people against our real opinions.

“For myself, I adhere to my former opinion, and wonder at those who
have proposed to reopen the case of the Mitylenians, and who are thus
causing a delay which is all in favour of the guilty, by making the
sufferer proceed against the offender with the edge of his anger
blunted; although where vengeance follows most closely upon the wrong,
it best equals it and most amply requites it. I wonder also who will be
the man who will maintain the contrary, and will pretend to show that
the crimes of the Mitylenians are of service to us, and our misfortunes
injurious to the allies. Such a man must plainly either have such
confidence in his rhetoric as to adventure to prove that what has been
once for all decided is still undetermined, or be bribed to try to
delude us by elaborate sophisms. In such contests the state gives the
rewards to others, and takes the dangers for herself. The persons to
blame are you who are so foolish as to institute these contests; who go
to see an oration as you would to see a sight, take your facts on
hearsay, judge of the practicability of a project by the wit of its
advocates, and trust for the truth as to past events not to the fact
which you saw more than to the clever strictures which you heard; the
easy victims of new-fangled arguments, unwilling to follow received
conclusions; slaves to every new paradox, despisers of the commonplace;
the first wish of every man being that he could speak himself, the next
to rival those who can speak by seeming to be quite up with their ideas
by applauding every hit almost before it is made, and by being as quick
in catching an argument as you are slow in foreseeing its consequences;
asking, if I may so say, for something different from the conditions
under which we live, and yet comprehending inadequately those very
conditions; very slaves to the pleasure of the ear, and more like the
audience of a rhetorician than the council of a city.

“In order to keep you from this, I proceed to show that no one state
has ever injured you as much as Mitylene. I can make allowance for
those who revolt because they cannot bear our empire, or who have been
forced to do so by the enemy. But for those who possessed an island
with fortifications; who could fear our enemies only by sea, and there
had their own force of galleys to protect them; who were independent
and held in the highest honour by you—to act as these have done, this
is not revolt—revolt implies oppression; it is deliberate and wanton
aggression; an attempt to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies;
a worse offence than a war undertaken on their own account in the
acquisition of power. The fate of those of their neighbours who had
already rebelled and had been subdued was no lesson to them; their own
prosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger; but blindly
confident in the future, and full of hopes beyond their power though
not beyond their ambition, they declared war and made their decision to
prefer might to right, their attack being determined not by provocation
but by the moment which seemed propitious. The truth is that great good
fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people
insolent; in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success in
reason than out of reason; and it is easier for them, one may say, to
stave off adversity than to preserve prosperity. Our mistake has been
to distinguish the Mitylenians as we have done: had they been long ago
treated like the rest, they never would have so far forgotten
themselves, human nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration
as it is awed by firmness. Let them now therefore be punished as their
crime requires, and do not, while you condemn the aristocracy, absolve
the people. This is certain, that all attacked you without distinction,
although they might have come over to us and been now again in
possession of their city. But no, they thought it safer to throw in
their lot with the aristocracy and so joined their rebellion! Consider
therefore: if you subject to the same punishment the ally who is forced
to rebel by the enemy, and him who does so by his own free choice,
which of them, think you, is there that will not rebel upon the
slightest pretext; when the reward of success is freedom, and the
penalty of failure nothing so very terrible? We meanwhile shall have to
risk our money and our lives against one state after another; and if
successful, shall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer
draw the revenue upon which our strength depends; while if
unsuccessful, we shall have an enemy the more upon our hands, and shall
spend the time that might be employed in combating our existing foes in
warring with our own allies.

“No hope, therefore, that rhetoric may instil or money purchase, of the
mercy due to human infirmity must be held out to the Mitylenians. Their
offence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy is
only for unwilling offenders. I therefore, now as before, persist
against your reversing your first decision, or giving way to the three
failings most fatal to empire—pity, sentiment, and indulgence.
Compassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to
those who will never pity us in return, but are our natural and
necessary foes: the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other
less important arenas for their talents, in the place of one where the
city pays a heavy penalty for a momentary pleasure, themselves
receiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases; while indulgence
should be shown towards those who will be our friends in future,
instead of towards men who will remain just what they were, and as much
our enemies as before. To sum up shortly, I say that if you follow my
advice you will do what is just towards the Mitylenians, and at the
same time expedient; while by a different decision you will not oblige
them so much as pass sentence upon yourselves. For if they were right
in rebelling, you must be wrong in ruling. However, if, right or wrong,
you determine to rule, you must carry out your principle and punish the
Mitylenians as your interest requires; or else you must give up your
empire and cultivate honesty without danger. Make up your minds,
therefore, to give them like for like; and do not let the victims who
escaped the plot be more insensible than the conspirators who hatched
it; but reflect what they would have done if victorious over you,
especially they were the aggressors. It is they who wrong their
neighbour without a cause, that pursue their victim to the death, on
account of the danger which they foresee in letting their enemy
survive; since the object of a wanton wrong is more dangerous, if he
escape, than an enemy who has not this to complain of. Do not,
therefore, be traitors to yourselves, but recall as nearly as possible
the moment of suffering and the supreme importance which you then
attached to their reduction; and now pay them back in their turn,
without yielding to present weakness or forgetting the peril that once
hung over you. Punish them as they deserve, and teach your other allies
by a striking example that the penalty of rebellion is death. Let them
once understand this and you will not have so often to neglect your
enemies while you are fighting with your own confederates.”

Such were the words of Cleon. After him Diodotus, son of Eucrates, who
had also in the previous assembly spoken most strongly against putting
the Mitylenians to death, came forward and spoke as follows:

“I do not blame the persons who have reopened the case of the
Mitylenians, nor do I approve the protests which we have heard against
important questions being frequently debated. I think the two things
most opposed to good counsel are haste and passion; haste usually goes
hand in hand with folly, passion with coarseness and narrowness of
mind. As for the argument that speech ought not to be the exponent of
action, the man who uses it must be either senseless or interested:
senseless if he believes it possible to treat of the uncertain future
through any other medium; interested if, wishing to carry a disgraceful
measure and doubting his ability to speak well in a bad cause, he
thinks to frighten opponents and hearers by well-aimed calumny. What is
still more intolerable is to accuse a speaker of making a display in
order to be paid for it. If ignorance only were imputed, an
unsuccessful speaker might retire with a reputation for honesty, if not
for wisdom; while the charge of dishonesty makes him suspected, if
successful, and thought, if defeated, not only a fool but a rogue. The
city is no gainer by such a system, since fear deprives it of its
advisers; although in truth, if our speakers are to make such
assertions, it would be better for the country if they could not speak
at all, as we should then make fewer blunders. The good citizen ought
to triumph not by frightening his opponents but by beating them fairly
in argument; and a wise city, without over-distinguishing its best
advisers, will nevertheless not deprive them of their due, and, far
from punishing an unlucky counsellor, will not even regard him as
disgraced. In this way successful orators would be least tempted to
sacrifice their convictions to popularity, in the hope of still higher
honours, and unsuccessful speakers to resort to the same popular arts
in order to win over the multitude.

“This is not our way; and, besides, the moment that a man is suspected
of giving advice, however good, from corrupt motives, we feel such a
grudge against him for the gain which after all we are not certain he
will receive, that we deprive the city of its certain benefit. Plain
good advice has thus come to be no less suspected than bad; and the
advocate of the most monstrous measures is not more obliged to use
deceit to gain the people, than the best counsellor is to lie in order
to be believed. The city and the city only, owing to these refinements,
can never be served openly and without disguise; he who does serve it
openly being always suspected of serving himself in some secret way in
return. Still, considering the magnitude of the interests involved, and
the position of affairs, we orators must make it our business to look a
little farther than you who judge offhand; especially as we, your
advisers, are responsible, while you, our audience, are not so. For if
those who gave the advice, and those who took it, suffered equally, you
would judge more calmly; as it is, you visit the disasters into which
the whim of the moment may have led you upon the single person of your
adviser, not upon yourselves, his numerous companions in error.

“However, I have not come forward either to oppose or to accuse in the
matter of Mitylene; indeed, the question before us as sensible men is
not their guilt, but our interests. Though I prove them ever so guilty,
I shall not, therefore, advise their death, unless it be expedient; nor
though they should have claims to indulgence, shall I recommend it,
unless it be dearly for the good of the country. I consider that we are
deliberating for the future more than for the present; and where Cleon
is so positive as to the useful deterrent effects that will follow from
making rebellion capital, I, who consider the interests of the future
quite as much as he, as positively maintain the contrary. And I require
you not to reject my useful considerations for his specious ones: his
speech may have the attraction of seeming the more just in your present
temper against Mitylene; but we are not in a court of justice, but in a
political assembly; and the question is not justice, but how to make
the Mitylenians useful to Athens.

“Now of course communities have enacted the penalty of death for many
offences far lighter than this: still hope leads men to venture, and no
one ever yet put himself in peril without the inward conviction that he
would succeed in his design. Again, was there ever city rebelling that
did not believe that it possessed either in itself or in its alliances
resources adequate to the enterprise? All, states and individuals, are
alike prone to err, and there is no law that will prevent them; or why
should men have exhausted the list of punishments in search of
enactments to protect them from evildoers? It is probable that in early
times the penalties for the greatest offences were less severe, and
that, as these were disregarded, the penalty of death has been by
degrees in most cases arrived at, which is itself disregarded in like
manner. Either then some means of terror more terrible than this must
be discovered, or it must be owned that this restraint is useless; and
that as long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity, or plenty
fills them with the ambition which belongs to insolence and pride, and
the other conditions of life remain each under the thraldom of some
fatal and master passion, so long will the impulse never be wanting to
drive men into danger. Hope also and cupidity, the one leading and the
other following, the one conceiving the attempt, the other suggesting
the facility of succeeding, cause the widest ruin, and, although
invisible agents, are far stronger than the dangers that are seen.
Fortune, too, powerfully helps the delusion and, by the unexpected aid
that she sometimes lends, tempts men to venture with inferior means;
and this is especially the case with communities, because the stakes
played for are the highest, freedom or empire, and, when all are acting
together, each man irrationally magnifies his own capacity. In fine, it
is impossible to prevent, and only great simplicity can hope to
prevent, human nature doing what it has once set its mind upon, by
force of law or by any other deterrent force whatsoever.

“We must not, therefore, commit ourselves to a false policy through a
belief in the efficacy of the punishment of death, or exclude rebels
from the hope of repentance and an early atonement of their error.
Consider a moment. At present, if a city that has already revolted
perceive that it cannot succeed, it will come to terms while it is
still able to refund expenses, and pay tribute afterwards. In the other
case, what city, think you, would not prepare better than is now done,
and hold out to the last against its besiegers, if it is all one
whether it surrender late or soon? And how can it be otherwise than
hurtful to us to be put to the expense of a siege, because surrender is
out of the question; and if we take the city, to receive a ruined town
from which we can no longer draw the revenue which forms our real
strength against the enemy? We must not, therefore, sit as strict
judges of the offenders to our own prejudice, but rather see how by
moderate chastisements we may be enabled to benefit in future by the
revenue-producing powers of our dependencies; and we must make up our
minds to look for our protection not to legal terrors but to careful
administration. At present we do exactly the opposite. When a free
community, held in subjection by force, rises, as is only natural, and
asserts its independence, it is no sooner reduced than we fancy
ourselves obliged to punish it severely; although the right course with
freemen is not to chastise them rigorously when they do rise, but
rigorously to watch them before they rise, and to prevent their ever
entertaining the idea, and, the insurrection suppressed, to make as few
responsible for it as possible.

“Only consider what a blunder you would commit in doing as Cleon
recommends. As things are at present, in all the cities the people is
your friend, and either does not revolt with the oligarchy, or, if
forced to do so, becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents; so that
in the war with the hostile city you have the masses on your side. But
if you butcher the people of Mitylene, who had nothing to do with the
revolt, and who, as soon as they got arms, of their own motion
surrendered the town, first you will commit the crime of killing your
benefactors; and next you will play directly into the hands of the
higher classes, who when they induce their cities to rise, will
immediately have the people on their side, through your having
announced in advance the same punishment for those who are guilty and
for those who are not. On the contrary, even if they were guilty, you
ought to seem not to notice it, in order to avoid alienating the only
class still friendly to us. In short, I consider it far more useful for
the preservation of our empire voluntarily to put up with injustice,
than to put to death, however justly, those whom it is our interest to
keep alive. As for Cleon’s idea that in punishment the claims of
justice and expediency can both be satisfied, facts do not confirm the
possibility of such a combination.

“Confess, therefore, that this is the wisest course, and without
conceding too much either to pity or to indulgence, by neither of which
motives do I any more than Cleon wish you to be influenced, upon the
plain merits of the case before you, be persuaded by me to try calmly
those of the Mitylenians whom Paches sent off as guilty, and to leave
the rest undisturbed. This is at once best for the future, and most
terrible to your enemies at the present moment; inasmuch as good policy
against an adversary is superior to the blind attacks of brute force.”

Such were the words of Diodotus. The two opinions thus expressed were
the ones that most directly contradicted each other; and the Athenians,
notwithstanding their change of feeling, now proceeded to a division,
in which the show of hands was almost equal, although the motion of
Diodotus carried the day. Another galley was at once sent off in haste,
for fear that the first might reach Lesbos in the interval, and the
city be found destroyed; the first ship having about a day and a
night’s start. Wine and barley-cakes were provided for the vessel by
the Mitylenian ambassadors, and great promises made if they arrived in
time; which caused the men to use such diligence upon the voyage that
they took their meals of barley-cakes kneaded with oil and wine as they
rowed, and only slept by turns while the others were at the oar.
Luckily they met with no contrary wind, and the first ship making no
haste upon so horrid an errand, while the second pressed on in the
manner described, the first arrived so little before them, that Paches
had only just had time to read the decree, and to prepare to execute
the sentence, when the second put into port and prevented the massacre.
The danger of Mitylene had indeed been great.

The other party whom Paches had sent off as the prime movers in the
rebellion, were upon Cleon’s motion put to death by the Athenians, the
number being rather more than a thousand. The Athenians also demolished
the walls of the Mitylenians, and took possession of their ships.
Afterwards tribute was not imposed upon the Lesbians; but all their
land, except that of the Methymnians, was divided into three thousand
allotments, three hundred of which were reserved as sacred for the
gods, and the rest assigned by lot to Athenian shareholders, who were
sent out to the island. With these the Lesbians agreed to pay a rent of
two minae a year for each allotment, and cultivated the land
themselves. The Athenians also took possession of the towns on the
continent belonging to the Mitylenians, which thus became for the
future subject to Athens. Such were the events that took place at
Lesbos.




CHAPTER X


Fifth Year of the War—Trial and Execution of the Plataeans— Corcyraean
Revolution


During the same summer, after the reduction of Lesbos, the Athenians
under Nicias, son of Niceratus, made an expedition against the island
of Minoa, which lies off Megara and was used as a fortified post by the
Megarians, who had built a tower upon it. Nicias wished to enable the
Athenians to maintain their blockade from this nearer station instead
of from Budorum and Salamis; to stop the Peloponnesian galleys and
privateers sailing out unobserved from the island, as they had been in
the habit of doing; and at the same time prevent anything from coming
into Megara. Accordingly, after taking two towers projecting on the
side of Nisaea, by engines from the sea, and clearing the entrance into
the channel between the island and the shore, he next proceeded to cut
off all communication by building a wall on the mainland at the point
where a bridge across a morass enabled succours to be thrown into the
island, which was not far off from the continent. A few days sufficing
to accomplish this, he afterwards raised some works in the island also,
and leaving a garrison there, departed with his forces.

About the same time in this summer, the Plataeans, being now without
provisions and unable to support the siege, surrendered to the
Peloponnesians in the following manner. An assault had been made upon
the wall, which the Plataeans were unable to repel. The Lacedaemonian
commander, perceiving their weakness, wished to avoid taking the place
by storm; his instructions from Lacedaemon having been so conceived, in
order that if at any future time peace should be made with Athens, and
they should agree each to restore the places that they had taken in the
war, Plataea might be held to have come over voluntarily, and not be
included in the list. He accordingly sent a herald to them to ask if
they were willing voluntarily to surrender the town to the
Lacedaemonians, and accept them as their judges, upon the understanding
that the guilty should be punished, but no one without form of law. The
Plataeans were now in the last state of weakness, and the herald had no
sooner delivered his message than they surrendered the town. The
Peloponnesians fed them for some days until the judges from Lacedaemon,
who were five in number, arrived. Upon their arrival no charge was
preferred; they simply called up the Plataeans, and asked them whether
they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war then
raging. The Plataeans asked leave to speak at greater length, and
deputed two of their number to represent them: Astymachus, son of
Asopolaus, and Lacon, son of Aeimnestus, proxenus of the
Lacedaemonians, who came forward and spoke as follows:

“Lacedaemonians, when we surrendered our city we trusted in you, and
looked forward to a trial more agreeable to the forms of law than the
present, to which we had no idea of being subjected; the judges also in
whose hands we consented to place ourselves were you, and you only
(from whom we thought we were most likely to obtain justice), and not
other persons, as is now the case. As matters stand, we are afraid that
we have been doubly deceived. We have good reason to suspect, not only
that the issue to be tried is the most terrible of all, but that you
will not prove impartial; if we may argue from the fact that no
accusation was first brought forward for us to answer, but we had
ourselves to ask leave to speak, and from the question being put so
shortly, that a true answer to it tells against us, while a false one
can be contradicted. In this dilemma, our safest, and indeed our only
course, seems to be to say something at all risks: placed as we are, we
could scarcely be silent without being tormented by the damning thought
that speaking might have saved us. Another difficulty that we have to
encounter is the difficulty of convincing you. Were we unknown to each
other we might profit by bringing forward new matter with which you
were unacquainted: as it is, we can tell you nothing that you do not
know already, and we fear, not that you have condemned us in your own
minds of having failed in our duty towards you, and make this our
crime, but that to please a third party we have to submit to a trial
the result of which is already decided. Nevertheless, we will place
before you what we can justly urge, not only on the question of the
quarrel which the Thebans have against us, but also as addressing you
and the rest of the Hellenes; and we will remind you of our good
services, and endeavour to prevail with you.

“To your short question, whether we have done the Lacedaemonians and
allies any service in this war, we say, if you ask us as enemies, that
to refrain from serving you was not to do you injury; if as friends,
that you are more in fault for having marched against us. During the
peace, and against the Mede, we acted well: we have not now been the
first to break the peace, and we were the only Boeotians who then
joined in defending against the Mede the liberty of Hellas. Although an
inland people, we were present at the action at Artemisium; in the
battle that took place in our territory we fought by the side of
yourselves and Pausanias; and in all the other Hellenic exploits of the
time we took a part quite out of proportion to our strength. Besides,
you, as Lacedaemonians, ought not to forget that at the time of the
great panic at Sparta, after the earthquake, caused by the secession of
the Helots to Ithome, we sent the third part of our citizens to assist
you.

“On these great and historical occasions such was the part that we
chose, although afterwards we became your enemies. For this you were to
blame. When we asked for your alliance against our Theban oppressors,
you rejected our petition, and told us to go to the Athenians who were
our neighbours, as you lived too far off. In the war we never have done
to you, and never should have done to you, anything unreasonable. If we
refused to desert the Athenians when you asked us, we did no wrong;
they had helped us against the Thebans when you drew back, and we could
no longer give them up with honour; especially as we had obtained their
alliance and had been admitted to their citizenship at our own request,
and after receiving benefits at their hands; but it was plainly our
duty loyally to obey their orders. Besides, the faults that either of
you may commit in your supremacy must be laid, not upon the followers,
but on the chiefs that lead them astray.

“With regard to the Thebans, they have wronged us repeatedly, and their
last aggression, which has been the means of bringing us into our
present position, is within your own knowledge. In seizing our city in
time of peace, and what is more at a holy time in the month, they
justly encountered our vengeance, in accordance with the universal law
which sanctions resistance to an invader; and it cannot now be right
that we should suffer on their account. By taking your own immediate
interest and their animosity as the test of justice, you will prove
yourselves to be rather waiters on expediency than judges of right;
although if they seem useful to you now, we and the rest of the
Hellenes gave you much more valuable help at a time of greater need.
Now you are the assailants, and others fear you; but at the crisis to
which we allude, when the barbarian threatened all with slavery, the
Thebans were on his side. It is just, therefore, to put our patriotism
then against our error now, if error there has been; and you will find
the merit outweighing the fault, and displayed at a juncture when there
were few Hellenes who would set their valour against the strength of
Xerxes, and when greater praise was theirs who preferred the dangerous
path of honour to the safe course of consulting their own interest with
respect to the invasion. To these few we belonged, and highly were we
honoured for it; and yet we now fear to perish by having again acted on
the same principles, and chosen to act well with Athens sooner than
wisely with Sparta. Yet in justice the same cases should be decided in
the same way, and policy should not mean anything else than lasting
gratitude for the service of good ally combined with a proper attention
to one’s own immediate interest.

“Consider also that at present the Hellenes generally regard you as a
pattern of worth and honour; and if you pass an unjust sentence upon us
in this which is no obscure cause, but one in which you, the judges,
are as illustrious as we, the prisoners, are blameless, take care that
displeasure be not felt at an unworthy decision in the matter of
honourable men made by men yet more honourable than they, and at the
consecration in the national temples of spoils taken from the
Plataeans, the benefactors of Hellas. Shocking indeed will it seem for
Lacedaemonians to destroy Plataea, and for the city whose name your
fathers inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi for its good service, to be
by you blotted out from the map of Hellas, to please the Thebans. To
such a depth of misfortune have we fallen that, while the Medes’
success had been our ruin, Thebans now supplant us in your once fond
regards; and we have been subjected to two dangers, the greatest of
any—that of dying of starvation then, if we had not surrendered our
town, and now of being tried for our lives. So that we Plataeans, after
exertions beyond our power in the cause of the Hellenes, are rejected
by all, forsaken and unassisted; helped by none of our allies, and
reduced to doubt the stability of our only hope, yourselves.

“Still, in the name of the gods who once presided over our confederacy,
and of our own good service in the Hellenic cause, we adjure you to
relent; to recall the decision which we fear that the Thebans may have
obtained from you; to ask back the gift that you have given them, that
they disgrace not you by slaying us; to gain a pure instead of a guilty
gratitude, and not to gratify others to be yourselves rewarded with
shame. Our lives may be quickly taken, but it will be a heavy task to
wipe away the infamy of the deed; as we are no enemies whom you might
justly punish, but friends forced into taking arms against you. To
grant us our lives would be, therefore, a righteous judgment; if you
consider also that we are prisoners who surrendered of their own
accord, stretching out our hands for quarter, whose slaughter Hellenic
law forbids, and who besides were always your benefactors. Look at the
sepulchres of your fathers, slain by the Medes and buried in our
country, whom year by year we honoured with garments and all other
dues, and the first-fruits of all that our land produced in their
season, as friends from a friendly country and allies to our old
companions in arms. Should you not decide aright, your conduct would be
the very opposite to ours. Consider only: Pausanias buried them
thinking that he was laying them in friendly ground and among men as
friendly; but you, if you kill us and make the Plataean territory
Theban, will leave your fathers and kinsmen in a hostile soil and among
their murderers, deprived of the honours which they now enjoy. What is
more, you will enslave the land in which the freedom of the Hellenes
was won, make desolate the temples of the gods to whom they prayed
before they overcame the Medes, and take away your ancestral sacrifices
from those who founded and instituted them.

“It were not to your glory, Lacedaemonians, either to offend in this
way against the common law of the Hellenes and against your own
ancestors, or to kill us your benefactors to gratify another’s hatred
without having been wronged yourselves: it were more so to spare us and
to yield to the impressions of a reasonable compassion; reflecting not
merely on the awful fate in store for us, but also on the character of
the sufferers, and on the impossibility of predicting how soon
misfortune may fall even upon those who deserve it not. We, as we have
a right to do and as our need impels us, entreat you, calling aloud
upon the gods at whose common altar all the Hellenes worship, to hear
our request, to be not unmindful of the oaths which your fathers swore,
and which we now plead—we supplicate you by the tombs of your fathers,
and appeal to those that are gone to save us from falling into the
hands of the Thebans and their dearest friends from being given up to
their most detested foes. We also remind you of that day on which we
did the most glorious deeds, by your fathers’ sides, we who now on this
are like to suffer the most dreadful fate. Finally, to do what is
necessary and yet most difficult for men in our situation—that is, to
make an end of speaking, since with that ending the peril of our lives
draws near—in conclusion we say that we did not surrender our city to
the Thebans (to that we would have preferred inglorious starvation),
but trusted in and capitulated to you; and it would be just, if we fail
to persuade you, to put us back in the same position and let us take
the chance that falls to us. And at the same time we adjure you not to
give us up—your suppliants, Lacedaemonians, out of your hands and
faith, Plataeans foremost of the Hellenic patriots, to Thebans, our
most hated enemies—but to be our saviours, and not, while you free the
rest of the Hellenes, to bring us to destruction.”

Such were the words of the Plataeans. The Thebans, afraid that the
Lacedaemonians might be moved by what they had heard, came forward and
said that they too desired to address them, since the Plataeans had,
against their wish, been allowed to speak at length instead of being
confined to a simple answer to the question. Leave being granted, the
Thebans spoke as follows:

“We should never have asked to make this speech if the Plataeans on
their side had contented themselves with shortly answering the
question, and had not turned round and made charges against us, coupled
with a long defence of themselves upon matters outside the present
inquiry and not even the subject of accusation, and with praise of what
no one finds fault with. However, since they have done so, we must
answer their charges and refute their self-praise, in order that
neither our bad name nor their good may help them, but that you may
hear the real truth on both points, and so decide.

“The origin of our quarrel was this. We settled Plataea some time after
the rest of Boeotia, together with other places out of which we had
driven the mixed population. The Plataeans not choosing to recognize
our supremacy, as had been first arranged, but separating themselves
from the rest of the Boeotians, and proving traitors to their
nationality, we used compulsion; upon which they went over to the
Athenians, and with them did as much harm, for which we retaliated.

“Next, when the barbarian invaded Hellas, they say that they were the
only Boeotians who did not Medize; and this is where they most glorify
themselves and abuse us. We say that if they did not Medize, it was
because the Athenians did not do so either; just as afterwards when the
Athenians attacked the Hellenes they, the Plataeans, were again the
only Boeotians who Atticized. And yet consider the forms of our
respective governments when we so acted. Our city at that juncture had
neither an oligarchical constitution in which all the nobles enjoyed
equal rights, nor a democracy, but that which is most opposed to law
and good government and nearest a tyranny—the rule of a close cabal.
These, hoping to strengthen their individual power by the success of
the Mede, kept down by force the people, and brought him into the town.
The city as a whole was not its own mistress when it so acted, and
ought not to be reproached for the errors that it committed while
deprived of its constitution. Examine only how we acted after the
departure of the Mede and the recovery of the constitution; when the
Athenians attacked the rest of Hellas and endeavoured to subjugate our
country, of the greater part of which faction had already made them
masters. Did not we fight and conquer at Coronea and liberate Boeotia,
and do we not now actively contribute to the liberation of the rest,
providing horses to the cause and a force unequalled by that of any
other state in the confederacy?

“Let this suffice to excuse us for our Medism. We will now endeavour to
show that you have injured the Hellenes more than we, and are more
deserving of condign punishment. It was in defence against us, say you,
that you became allies and citizens of Athens. If so, you ought only to
have called in the Athenians against us, instead of joining them in
attacking others: it was open to you to do this if you ever felt that
they were leading you where you did not wish to follow, as Lacedaemon
was already your ally against the Mede, as you so much insist; and this
was surely sufficient to keep us off, and above all to allow you to
deliberate in security. Nevertheless, of your own choice and without
compulsion you chose to throw your lot in with Athens. And you say that
it had been base for you to betray your benefactors; but it was surely
far baser and more iniquitous to sacrifice the whole body of the
Hellenes, your fellow confederates, who were liberating Hellas, than
the Athenians only, who were enslaving it. The return that you made
them was therefore neither equal nor honourable, since you called them
in, as you say, because you were being oppressed yourselves, and then
became their accomplices in oppressing others; although baseness rather
consists in not returning like for like than in not returning what is
justly due but must be unjustly paid.

“Meanwhile, after thus plainly showing that it was not for the sake of
the Hellenes that you alone then did not Medize, but because the
Athenians did not do so either, and you wished to side with them and to
be against the rest; you now claim the benefit of good deeds done to
please your neighbours. This cannot be admitted: you chose the
Athenians, and with them you must stand or fall. Nor can you plead the
league then made and claim that it should now protect you. You
abandoned that league, and offended against it by helping instead of
hindering the subjugation of the Aeginetans and others of its members,
and that not under compulsion, but while in enjoyment of the same
institutions that you enjoy to the present hour, and no one forcing you
as in our case. Lastly, an invitation was addressed to you before you
were blockaded to be neutral and join neither party: this you did not
accept. Who then merit the detestation of the Hellenes more justly than
you, you who sought their ruin under the mask of honour? The former
virtues that you allege you now show not to be proper to your
character; the real bent of your nature has been at length damningly
proved: when the Athenians took the path of injustice you followed
them.

“Of our unwilling Medism and your wilful Atticizing this then is our
explanation. The last wrong wrong of which you complain consists in our
having, as you say, lawlessly invaded your town in time of peace and
festival. Here again we cannot think that we were more in fault than
yourselves. If of our own proper motion we made an armed attack upon
your city and ravaged your territory, we are guilty; but if the first
men among you in estate and family, wishing to put an end to the
foreign connection and to restore you to the common Boeotian country,
of their own free will invited us, wherein is our crime? Where wrong is
done, those who lead, as you say, are more to blame than those who
follow. Not that, in our judgment, wrong was done either by them or by
us. Citizens like yourselves, and with more at stake than you, they
opened their own walls and introduced us into their own city, not as
foes but as friends, to prevent the bad among you from becoming worse;
to give honest men their due; to reform principles without attacking
persons, since you were not to be banished from your city, but brought
home to your kindred, nor to be made enemies to any, but friends alike
to all.

“That our intention was not hostile is proved by our behaviour. We did
no harm to any one, but publicly invited those who wished to live under
a national, Boeotian government to come over to us; which as first you
gladly did, and made an agreement with us and remained tranquil, until
you became aware of the smallness of our numbers. Now it is possible
that there may have been something not quite fair in our entering
without the consent of your commons. At any rate you did not repay us
in kind. Instead of refraining, as we had done, from violence, and
inducing us to retire by negotiation, you fell upon us in violation of
your agreement, and slew some of us in fight, of which we do not so
much complain, for in that there was a certain justice; but others who
held out their hands and received quarter, and whose lives you
subsequently promised us, you lawlessly butchered. If this was not
abominable, what is? And after these three crimes committed one after
the other—the violation of your agreement, the murder of the men
afterwards, and the lying breach of your promise not to kill them, if
we refrained from injuring your property in the country—you still
affirm that we are the criminals and yourselves pretend to escape
justice. Not so, if these your judges decide aright, but you will be
punished for all together.

“Such, Lacedaemonians, are the facts. We have gone into them at some
length both on your account and on our own, that you may fed that you
will justly condemn the prisoners, and we, that we have given an
additional sanction to our vengeance. We would also prevent you from
being melted by hearing of their past virtues, if any such they had:
these may be fairly appealed to by the victims of injustice, but only
aggravate the guilt of criminals, since they offend against their
better nature. Nor let them gain anything by crying and wailing, by
calling upon your fathers’ tombs and their own desolate condition.
Against this we point to the far more dreadful fate of our youth,
butchered at their hands; the fathers of whom either fell at Coronea,
bringing Boeotia over to you, or seated, forlorn old men by desolate
hearths, with far more reason implore your justice upon the prisoners.
The pity which they appeal to is rather due to men who suffer
unworthily; those who suffer justly as they do are on the contrary
subjects for triumph. For their present desolate condition they have
themselves to blame, since they wilfully rejected the better alliance.
Their lawless act was not provoked by any action of ours: hate, not
justice, inspired their decision; and even now the satisfaction which
they afford us is not adequate; they will suffer by a legal sentence,
not as they pretend as suppliants asking for quarter in battle, but as
prisoners who have surrendered upon agreement to take their trial.
Vindicate, therefore, Lacedaemonians, the Hellenic law which they have
broken; and to us, the victims of its violation, grant the reward
merited by our zeal. Nor let us be supplanted in your favour by their
harangues, but offer an example to the Hellenes, that the contests to
which you invite them are of deeds, not words: good deeds can be
shortly stated, but where wrong is done a wealth of language is needed
to veil its deformity. However, if leading powers were to do what you
are now doing, and putting one short question to all alike were to
decide accordingly, men would be less tempted to seek fine phrases to
cover bad actions.”

Such were the words of the Thebans. The Lacedaemonian judges decided
that the question whether they had received any service from the
Plataeans in the war, was a fair one for them to put; as they had
always invited them to be neutral, agreeably to the original covenant
of Pausanias after the defeat of the Mede, and had again definitely
offered them the same conditions before the blockade. This offer having
been refused, they were now, they conceived, by the loyalty of their
intention released from their covenant; and having, as they considered,
suffered evil at the hands of the Plataeans, they brought them in again
one by one and asked each of them the same question, that is to say,
whether they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the
war; and upon their saying that they had not, took them out and slew
them, all without exception. The number of Plataeans thus massacred was
not less than two hundred, with twenty-five Athenians who had shared in
the siege. The women were taken as slaves. The city the Thebans gave
for about a year to some political emigrants from Megara and to the
surviving Plataeans of their own party to inhabit, and afterwards razed
it to the ground from the very foundations, and built on to the
precinct of Hera an inn two hundred feet square, with rooms all round
above and below, making use for this purpose of the roofs and doors of
the Plataeans: of the rest of the materials in the wall, the brass and
the iron, they made couches which they dedicated to Hera, for whom they
also built a stone chapel of a hundred feet square. The land they
confiscated and let out on a ten years’ lease to Theban occupiers. The
adverse attitude of the Lacedaemonians in the whole Plataean affair was
mainly adopted to please the Thebans, who were thought to be useful in
the war at that moment raging. Such was the end of Plataea, in the
ninety-third year after she became the ally of Athens.

Meanwhile, the forty ships of the Peloponnesians that had gone to the
relief of the Lesbians, and which we left flying across the open sea,
pursued by the Athenians, were caught in a storm off Crete, and
scattering from thence made their way to Peloponnese, where they found
at Cyllene thirteen Leucadian and Ambraciot galleys, with Brasidas, son
of Tellis, lately arrived as counsellor to Alcidas; the Lacedaemonians,
upon the failure of the Lesbian expedition, having resolved to
strengthen their fleet and sail to Corcyra, where a revolution had
broken out, so as to arrive there before the twelve Athenian ships at
Naupactus could be reinforced from Athens. Brasidas and Alcidas began
to prepare accordingly.

The Corcyraean revolution began with the return of the prisoners taken
in the sea-fights off Epidamnus. These the Corinthians had released,
nominally upon the security of eight hundred talents given by their
proxeni, but in reality upon their engagement to bring over Corcyra to
Corinth. These men proceeded to canvass each of the citizens, and to
intrigue with the view of detaching the city from Athens. Upon the
arrival of an Athenian and a Corinthian vessel, with envoys on board, a
conference was held in which the Corcyraeans voted to remain allies of
the Athenians according to their agreement, but to be friends of the
Peloponnesians as they had been formerly. Meanwhile, the returned
prisoners brought Peithias, a volunteer proxenus of the Athenians and
leader of the commons, to trial, upon the charge of enslaving Corcyra
to Athens. He, being acquitted, retorted by accusing five of the
richest of their number of cutting stakes in the ground sacred to Zeus
and Alcinous; the legal penalty being a stater for each stake. Upon
their conviction, the amount of the penalty being very large, they
seated themselves as suppliants in the temples to be allowed to pay it
by instalments; but Peithias, who was one of the senate, prevailed upon
that body to enforce the law; upon which the accused, rendered
desperate by the law, and also learning that Peithias had the
intention, while still a member of the senate, to persuade the people
to conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with Athens, banded
together armed with daggers, and suddenly bursting into the senate
killed Peithias and sixty others, senators and private persons; some
few only of the party of Peithias taking refuge in the Athenian galley,
which had not yet departed.

After this outrage, the conspirators summoned the Corcyraeans to an
assembly, and said that this would turn out for the best, and would
save them from being enslaved by Athens: for the future, they moved to
receive neither party unless they came peacefully in a single ship,
treating any larger number as enemies. This motion made, they compelled
it to be adopted, and instantly sent off envoys to Athens to justify
what had been done and to dissuade the refugees there from any hostile
proceedings which might lead to a reaction.

Upon the arrival of the embassy, the Athenians arrested the envoys and
all who listened to them, as revolutionists, and lodged them in Aegina.
Meanwhile a Corinthian galley arriving in the island with Lacedaemonian
envoys, the dominant Corcyraean party attacked the commons and defeated
them in battle. Night coming on, the commons took refuge in the
Acropolis and the higher parts of the city, and concentrated themselves
there, having also possession of the Hyllaic harbour; their adversaries
occupying the market-place, where most of them lived, and the harbour
adjoining, looking towards the mainland.

The next day passed in skirmishes of little importance, each party
sending into the country to offer freedom to the slaves and to invite
them to join them. The mass of the slaves answered the appeal of the
commons; their antagonists being reinforced by eight hundred
mercenaries from the continent.

After a day’s interval hostilities recommenced, victory remaining with
the commons, who had the advantage in numbers and position, the women
also valiantly assisting them, pelting with tiles from the houses, and
supporting the melee with a fortitude beyond their sex. Towards dusk,
the oligarchs in full rout, fearing that the victorious commons might
assault and carry the arsenal and put them to the sword, fired the
houses round the marketplace and the lodging-houses, in order to bar
their advance; sparing neither their own, nor those of their
neighbours; by which much stuff of the merchants was consumed and the
city risked total destruction, if a wind had come to help the flame by
blowing on it. Hostilities now ceasing, both sides kept quiet, passing
the night on guard, while the Corinthian ship stole out to sea upon the
victory of the commons, and most of the mercenaries passed over
secretly to the continent.

The next day the Athenian general, Nicostratus, son of Diitrephes, came
up from Naupactus with twelve ships and five hundred Messenian heavy
infantry. He at once endeavoured to bring about a settlement, and
persuaded the two parties to agree together to bring to trial ten of
the ringleaders, who presently fled, while the rest were to live in
peace, making terms with each other, and entering into a defensive and
offensive alliance with the Athenians. This arranged, he was about to
sail away, when the leaders of the commons induced him to leave them
five of his ships to make their adversaries less disposed to move,
while they manned and sent with him an equal number of their own. He
had no sooner consented, than they began to enroll their enemies for
the ships; and these, fearing that they might be sent off to Athens,
seated themselves as suppliants in the temple of the Dioscuri. An
attempt on the part of Nicostratus to reassure them and to persuade
them to rise proving unsuccessful, the commons armed upon this pretext,
alleging the refusal of their adversaries to sail with them as a proof
of the hollowness of their intentions, and took their arms out of their
houses, and would have dispatched some whom they fell in with, if
Nicostratus had not prevented it. The rest of the party, seeing what
was going on, seated themselves as suppliants in the temple of Hera,
being not less than four hundred in number; until the commons, fearing
that they might adopt some desperate resolution, induced them to rise,
and conveyed them over to the island in front of the temple, where
provisions were sent across to them.

At this stage in the revolution, on the fourth or fifth day after the
removal of the men to the island, the Peloponnesian ships arrived from
Cyllene where they had been stationed since their return from Ionia,
fifty-three in number, still under the command of Alcidas, but with
Brasidas also on board as his adviser; and dropping anchor at Sybota, a
harbour on the mainland, at daybreak made sail for Corcyra.

The Corcyraeans in great confusion and alarm at the state of things in
the city and at the approach of the invader, at once proceeded to equip
sixty vessels, which they sent out, as fast as they were manned,
against the enemy, in spite of the Athenians recommending them to let
them sail out first, and to follow themselves afterwards with all their
ships together. Upon their vessels coming up to the enemy in this
straggling fashion, two immediately deserted: in others the crews were
fighting among themselves, and there was no order in anything that was
done; so that the Peloponnesians, seeing their confusion, placed twenty
ships to oppose the Corcyraeans, and ranged the rest against the twelve
Athenian ships, amongst which were the two vessels Salaminia and
Paralus.

While the Corcyraeans, attacking without judgment and in small
detachments, were already crippled by their own misconduct, the
Athenians, afraid of the numbers of the enemy and of being surrounded,
did not venture to attack the main body or even the centre of the
division opposed to them, but fell upon its wing and sank one vessel;
after which the Peloponnesians formed in a circle, and the Athenians
rowed round them and tried to throw them into disorder. Perceiving
this, the division opposed to the Corcyraeans, fearing a repetition of
the disaster of Naupactus, came to support their friends, and the whole
fleet now bore down, united, upon the Athenians, who retired before it,
backing water, retiring as leisurely as possible in order to give the
Corcyraeans time to escape, while the enemy was thus kept occupied.
Such was the character of this sea-fight, which lasted until sunset.

The Corcyraeans now feared that the enemy would follow up their victory
and sail against the town and rescue the men in the island, or strike
some other blow equally decisive, and accordingly carried the men over
again to the temple of Hera, and kept guard over the city. The
Peloponnesians, however, although victorious in the sea-fight, did not
venture to attack the town, but took the thirteen Corcyraean vessels
which they had captured, and with them sailed back to the continent
from whence they had put out. The next day equally they refrained from
attacking the city, although the disorder and panic were at their
height, and though Brasidas, it is said, urged Alcidas, his superior
officer, to do so, but they landed upon the promontory of Leukimme and
laid waste the country.

Meanwhile the commons in Corcyra, being still in great fear of the
fleet attacking them, came to a parley with the suppliants and their
friends, in order to save the town; and prevailed upon some of them to
go on board the ships, of which they still manned thirty, against the
expected attack. But the Peloponnesians after ravaging the country
until midday sailed away, and towards nightfall were informed by beacon
signals of the approach of sixty Athenian vessels from Leucas, under
the command of Eurymedon, son of Thucles; which had been sent off by
the Athenians upon the news of the revolution and of the fleet with
Alcidas being about to sail for Corcyra.

The Peloponnesians accordingly at once set off in haste by night for
home, coasting along shore; and hauling their ships across the Isthmus
of Leucas, in order not to be seen doubling it, so departed. The
Corcyraeans, made aware of the approach of the Athenian fleet and of
the departure of the enemy, brought the Messenians from outside the
walls into the town, and ordered the fleet which they had manned to
sail round into the Hyllaic harbour; and while it was so doing, slew
such of their enemies as they laid hands on, dispatching afterwards, as
they landed them, those whom they had persuaded to go on board the
ships. Next they went to the sanctuary of Hera and persuaded about
fifty men to take their trial, and condemned them all to death. The
mass of the suppliants who had refused to do so, on seeing what was
taking place, slew each other there in the consecrated ground; while
some hanged themselves upon the trees, and others destroyed themselves
as they were severally able. During seven days that Eurymedon stayed
with his sixty ships, the Corcyraeans were engaged in butchering those
of their fellow citizens whom they regarded as their enemies: and
although the crime imputed was that of attempting to put down the
democracy, some were slain also for private hatred, others by their
debtors because of the moneys owed to them. Death thus raged in every
shape; and, as usually happens at such times, there was no length to
which violence did not go; sons were killed by their fathers, and
suppliants dragged from the altar or slain upon it; while some were
even walled up in the temple of Dionysus and died there.

So bloody was the march of the revolution, and the impression which it
made was the greater as it was one of the first to occur. Later on, one
may say, the whole Hellenic world was convulsed; struggles being every,
where made by the popular chiefs to bring in the Athenians, and by the
oligarchs to introduce the Lacedaemonians. In peace there would have
been neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but
in war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for
the hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage,
opportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the
revolutionary parties. The sufferings which revolution entailed upon
the cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always
will occur, as long as the nature of mankind remains the same; though
in a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms, according
to the variety of the particular cases. In peace and prosperity, states
and individuals have better sentiments, because they do not find
themselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war
takes away the easy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough
master, that brings most men’s characters to a level with their
fortunes. Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the
places which it arrived at last, from having heard what had been done
before, carried to a still greater excess the refinement of their
inventions, as manifested in the cunning of their enterprises and the
atrocity of their reprisals. Words had to change their ordinary meaning
and to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be
considered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious
cowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability
to see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. Frantic
violence became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a
justifiable means of self-defence. The advocate of extreme measures was
always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a
plot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but
to try to provide against having to do either was to break up your
party and to be afraid of your adversaries. In fine, to forestall an
intending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was
wanting, was equally commended until even blood became a weaker tie
than party, from the superior readiness of those united by the latter
to dare everything without reserve; for such associations had not in
view the blessings derivable from established institutions but were
formed by ambition for their overthrow; and the confidence of their
members in each other rested less on any religious sanction than upon
complicity in crime. The fair proposals of an adversary were met with
jealous precautions by the stronger of the two, and not with a generous
confidence. Revenge also was held of more account than
self-preservation. Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on
either side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as
no other weapon was at hand; but when opportunity offered, he who first
ventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard, thought this
perfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one, since, considerations of
safety apart, success by treachery won him the palm of superior
intelligence. Indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to
call rogues clever than simpletons honest, and are as ashamed of being
the second as they are proud of being the first. The cause of all these
evils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition; and from
these passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in
contention. The leaders in the cities, each provided with the fairest
professions, on the one side with the cry of political equality of the
people, on the other of a moderate aristocracy, sought prizes for
themselves in those public interests which they pretended to cherish,
and, recoiling from no means in their struggles for ascendancy engaged
in the direst excesses; in their acts of vengeance they went to even
greater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state
demanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their only
standard, and invoking with equal readiness the condemnation of an
unjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm to glut the
animosities of the hour. Thus religion was in honour with neither
party; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high
reputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished
between the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy
would not suffer them to escape.

Thus every form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by
reason of the troubles. The ancient simplicity into which honour so
largely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became
divided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow. To put an end to
this, there was neither promise to be depended upon, nor oath that
could command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their
calculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were
more intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence. In this
contest the blunter wits were most successful. Apprehensive of their
own deficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists, they
feared to be worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations
of their more versatile opponents, and so at once boldly had recourse
to action: while their adversaries, arrogantly thinking that they
should know in time, and that it was unnecessary to secure by action
what policy afforded, often fell victims to their want of precaution.

Meanwhile Corcyra gave the first example of most of the crimes alluded
to; of the reprisals exacted by the governed who had never experienced
equitable treatment or indeed aught but insolence from their
rulers—when their hour came; of the iniquitous resolves of those who
desired to get rid of their accustomed poverty, and ardently coveted
their neighbours’ goods; and lastly, of the savage and pitiless
excesses into which men who had begun the struggle, not in a class but
in a party spirit, were hurried by their ungovernable passions. In the
confusion into which life was now thrown in the cities, human nature,
always rebelling against the law and now its master, gladly showed
itself ungoverned in passion, above respect for justice, and the enemy
of all superiority; since revenge would not have been set above
religion, and gain above justice, had it not been for the fatal power
of envy. Indeed men too often take upon themselves in the prosecution
of their revenge to set the example of doing away with those general
laws to which all alike can look for salvation in adversity, instead of
allowing them to subsist against the day of danger when their aid may
be required.

While the revolutionary passions thus for the first time displayed
themselves in the factions of Corcyra, Eurymedon and the Athenian fleet
sailed away; after which some five hundred Corcyraean exiles who had
succeeded in escaping, took some forts on the mainland, and becoming
masters of the Corcyraean territory over the water, made this their
base to Plunder their countrymen in the island, and did so much damage
as to cause a severe famine in the town. They also sent envoys to
Lacedaemon and Corinth to negotiate their restoration; but meeting with
no success, afterwards got together boats and mercenaries and crossed
over to the island, being about six hundred in all; and burning their
boats so as to have no hope except in becoming masters of the country,
went up to Mount Istone, and fortifying themselves there, began to
annoy those in the city and obtained command of the country.

At the close of the same summer the Athenians sent twenty ships under
the command of Laches, son of Melanopus, and Charoeades, son of
Euphiletus, to Sicily, where the Syracusans and Leontines were at war.
The Syracusans had for allies all the Dorian cities except
Camarina—these had been included in the Lacedaemonian confederacy from
the commencement of the war, though they had not taken any active part
in it—the Leontines had Camarina and the Chalcidian cities. In Italy
the Locrians were for the Syracusans, the Rhegians for their Leontine
kinsmen. The allies of the Leontines now sent to Athens and appealed to
their ancient alliance and to their Ionian origin, to persuade the
Athenians to send them a fleet, as the Syracusans were blockading them
by land and sea. The Athenians sent it upon the plea of their common
descent, but in reality to prevent the exportation of Sicilian corn to
Peloponnese and to test the possibility of bringing Sicily into
subjection. Accordingly they established themselves at Rhegium in
Italy, and from thence carried on the war in concert with their allies.




CHAPTER XI


Year of the War—Campaigns of Demosthenes in Western Greece—Ruin of
Ambracia


Summer was now over. The winter following, the plague a second time
attacked the Athenians; for although it had never entirely left them,
still there had been a notable abatement in its ravages. The second
visit lasted no less than a year, the first having lasted two; and
nothing distressed the Athenians and reduced their power more than
this. No less than four thousand four hundred heavy infantry in the
ranks died of it and three hundred cavalry, besides a number of the
multitude that was never ascertained. At the same time took place the
numerous earthquakes in Athens, Euboea, and Boeotia, particularly at
Orchomenus in the last-named country.

The same winter the Athenians in Sicily and the Rhegians, with thirty
ships, made an expedition against the islands of Aeolus; it being
impossible to invade them in summer, owing to the want of water. These
islands are occupied by the Liparaeans, a Cnidian colony, who live in
one of them of no great size called Lipara; and from this as their
headquarters cultivate the rest, Didyme, Strongyle, and Hiera. In Hiera
the people in those parts believe that Hephaestus has his forge, from
the quantity of flame which they see it send out by night, and of smoke
by day. These islands lie off the coast of the Sicels and Messinese,
and were allies of the Syracusans. The Athenians laid waste their land,
and as the inhabitants did not submit, sailed back to Rhegium. Thus the
winter ended, and with it ended the fifth year of this war, of which
Thucydides was the historian.

The next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies set out to invade
Attica under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, and went as far as
the Isthmus, but numerous earthquakes occurring, turned back again
without the invasion taking place. About the same time that these
earthquakes were so common, the sea at Orobiae, in Euboea, retiring
from the then line of coast, returned in a huge wave and invaded a
great part of the town, and retreated leaving some of it still under
water; so that what was once land is now sea; such of the inhabitants
perishing as could not run up to the higher ground in time. A similar
inundation also occurred at Atalanta, the island off the Opuntian
Locrian coast, carrying away part of the Athenian fort and wrecking one
of two ships which were drawn up on the beach. At Peparethus also the
sea retreated a little, without however any inundation following; and
an earthquake threw down part of the wall, the town hall, and a few
other buildings. The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be
sought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the
most violent, the sea is driven back and, suddenly recoiling with
redoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not
see how such an accident could happen.

During the same summer different operations were carried on by the
different belligerents in Sicily; by the Siceliots themselves against
each other, and by the Athenians and their allies: I shall however
confine myself to the actions in which the Athenians took part,
choosing the most important. The death of the Athenian general
Charoeades, killed by the Syracusans in battle, left Laches in the sole
command of the fleet, which he now directed in concert with the allies
against Mylae, a place belonging to the Messinese. Two Messinese
battalions in garrison at Mylae laid an ambush for the party landing
from the ships, but were routed with great slaughter by the Athenians
and their allies, who thereupon assaulted the fortification and
compelled them to surrender the Acropolis and to march with them upon
Messina. This town afterwards also submitted upon the approach of the
Athenians and their allies, and gave hostages and all other securities
required.

The same summer the Athenians sent thirty ships round Peloponnese under
Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and Procles, son of Theodorus, and
sixty others, with two thousand heavy infantry, against Melos, under
Nicias, son of Niceratus; wishing to reduce the Melians, who, although
islanders, refused to be subjects of Athens or even to join her
confederacy. The devastation of their land not procuring their
submission, the fleet, weighing from Melos, sailed to Oropus in the
territory of Graea, and landing at nightfall, the heavy infantry
started at once from the ships by land for Tanagra in Boeotia, where
they were met by the whole levy from Athens, agreeably to a concerted
signal, under the command of Hipponicus, son of Callias, and Eurymedon,
son of Thucles. They encamped, and passing that day in ravaging the
Tanagraean territory, remained there for the night; and next day, after
defeating those of the Tanagraeans who sailed out against them and some
Thebans who had come up to help the Tanagraeans, took some arms, set up
a trophy, and retired, the troops to the city and the others to the
ships. Nicias with his sixty ships coasted alongshore and ravaged the
Locrian seaboard, and so returned home.

About this time the Lacedaemonians founded their colony of Heraclea in
Trachis, their object being the following: the Malians form in all
three tribes, the Paralians, the Hiereans, and the Trachinians. The
last of these having suffered severely in a war with their neighbours
the Oetaeans, at first intended to give themselves up to Athens; but
afterwards fearing not to find in her the security that they sought,
sent to Lacedaemon, having chosen Tisamenus for their ambassador. In
this embassy joined also the Dorians from the mother country of the
Lacedaemonians, with the same request, as they themselves also suffered
from the same enemy. After hearing them, the Lacedaemonians determined
to send out the colony, wishing to assist the Trachinians and Dorians,
and also because they thought that the proposed town would lie
conveniently for the purposes of the war against the Athenians. A fleet
might be got ready there against Euboea, with the advantage of a short
passage to the island; and the town would also be useful as a station
on the road to Thrace. In short, everything made the Lacedaemonians
eager to found the place. After first consulting the god at Delphi and
receiving a favourable answer, they sent off the colonists, Spartans,
and Perioeci, inviting also any of the rest of the Hellenes who might
wish to accompany them, except Ionians, Achaeans, and certain other
nationalities; three Lacedaemonians leading as founders of the colony,
Leon, Alcidas, and Damagon. The settlement effected, they fortified
anew the city, now called Heraclea, distant about four miles and a half
from Thermopylae and two miles and a quarter from the sea, and
commenced building docks, closing the side towards Thermopylae just by
the pass itself, in order that they might be easily defended.

The foundation of this town, evidently meant to annoy Euboea (the
passage across to Cenaeum in that island being a short one), at first
caused some alarm at Athens, which the event however did nothing to
justify, the town never giving them any trouble. The reason of this was
as follows. The Thessalians, who were sovereign in those parts, and
whose territory was menaced by its foundation, were afraid that it
might prove a very powerful neighbour, and accordingly continually
harassed and made war upon the new settlers, until they at last wore
them out in spite of their originally considerable numbers, people
flocking from all quarters to a place founded by the Lacedaemonians,
and thus thought secure of prosperity. On the other hand the
Lacedaemonians themselves, in the persons of their governors, did their
full share towards ruining its prosperity and reducing its population,
as they frightened away the greater part of the inhabitants by
governing harshly and in some cases not fairly, and thus made it easier
for their neighbours to prevail against them.

The same summer, about the same time that the Athenians were detained
at Melos, their fellow citizens in the thirty ships cruising round
Peloponnese, after cutting off some guards in an ambush at Ellomenus in
Leucadia, subsequently went against Leucas itself with a large
armament, having been reinforced by the whole levy of the Acarnanians
except Oeniadae, and by the Zacynthians and Cephallenians and fifteen
ships from Corcyra. While the Leucadians witnessed the devastation of
their land, without and within the isthmus upon which the town of
Leucas and the temple of Apollo stand, without making any movement on
account of the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, the Acarnanians urged
Demosthenes, the Athenian general, to build a wall so as to cut off the
town from the continent, a measure which they were convinced would
secure its capture and rid them once and for all of a most troublesome
enemy.

Demosthenes however had in the meanwhile been persuaded by the
Messenians that it was a fine opportunity for him, having so large an
army assembled, to attack the Aetolians, who were not only the enemies
of Naupactus, but whose reduction would further make it easy to gain
the rest of that part of the continent for the Athenians. The Aetolian
nation, although numerous and warlike, yet dwelt in unwalled villages
scattered far apart, and had nothing but light armour, and might,
according to the Messenians, be subdued without much difficulty before
succours could arrive. The plan which they recommended was to attack
first the Apodotians, next the Ophionians, and after these the
Eurytanians, who are the largest tribe in Aetolia, and speak, as is
said, a language exceedingly difficult to understand, and eat their
flesh raw. These once subdued, the rest would easily come in.

To this plan Demosthenes consented, not only to please the Messenians,
but also in the belief that by adding the Aetolians to his other
continental allies he would be able, without aid from home, to march
against the Boeotians by way of Ozolian Locris to Kytinium in Doris,
keeping Parnassus on his right until he descended to the Phocians, whom
he could force to join him if their ancient friendship for Athens did
not, as he anticipated, at once decide them to do so. Arrived in Phocis
he was already upon the frontier of Boeotia. He accordingly weighed
from Leucas, against the wish of the Acarnanians, and with his whole
armament sailed along the coast to Sollium, where he communicated to
them his intention; and upon their refusing to agree to it on account
of the non-investment of Leucas, himself with the rest of the forces,
the Cephallenians, the Messenians, and Zacynthians, and three hundred
Athenian marines from his own ships (the fifteen Corcyraean vessels
having departed), started on his expedition against the Aetolians. His
base he established at Oeneon in Locris, as the Ozolian Locrians were
allies of Athens and were to meet him with all their forces in the
interior. Being neighbours of the Aetolians and armed in the same way,
it was thought that they would be of great service upon the expedition,
from their acquaintance with the localities and the warfare of the
inhabitants.

After bivouacking with the army in the precinct of Nemean Zeus, in
which the poet Hesiod is said to have been killed by the people of the
country, according to an oracle which had foretold that he should die
in Nemea, Demosthenes set out at daybreak to invade Aetolia. The first
day he took Potidania, the next Krokyle, and the third Tichium, where
he halted and sent back the booty to Eupalium in Locris, having
determined to pursue his conquests as far as the Ophionians, and, in
the event of their refusing to submit, to return to Naupactus and make
them the objects of a second expedition. Meanwhile the Aetolians had
been aware of his design from the moment of its formation, and as soon
as the army invaded their country came up in great force with all their
tribes; even the most remote Ophionians, the Bomiensians, and
Calliensians, who extend towards the Malian Gulf, being among the
number.

The Messenians, however, adhered to their original advice. Assuring
Demosthenes that the Aetolians were an easy conquest, they urged him to
push on as rapidly as possible, and to try to take the villages as fast
as he came up to them, without waiting until the whole nation should be
in arms against him. Led on by his advisers and trusting in his
fortune, as he had met with no opposition, without waiting for his
Locrian reinforcements, who were to have supplied him with the
light-armed darters in which he was most deficient, he advanced and
stormed Aegitium, the inhabitants flying before him and posting
themselves upon the hills above the town, which stood on high ground
about nine miles from the sea. Meanwhile the Aetolians had gathered to
the rescue, and now attacked the Athenians and their allies, running
down from the hills on every side and darting their javelins, falling
back when the Athenian army advanced, and coming on as it retired; and
for a long while the battle was of this character, alternate advance
and retreat, in both which operations the Athenians had the worst.

Still as long as their archers had arrows left and were able to use
them, they held out, the light-armed Aetolians retiring before the
arrows; but after the captain of the archers had been killed and his
men scattered, the soldiers, wearied out with the constant repetition
of the same exertions and hard pressed by the Aetolians with their
javelins, at last turned and fled, and falling into pathless gullies
and places that they were unacquainted with, thus perished, the
Messenian Chromon, their guide, having also unfortunately been killed.
A great many were overtaken in the pursuit by the swift-footed and
light-armed Aetolians, and fell beneath their javelins; the greater
number however missed their road and rushed into the wood, which had no
ways out, and which was soon fired and burnt round them by the enemy.
Indeed the Athenian army fell victims to death in every form, and
suffered all the vicissitudes of flight; the survivors escaped with
difficulty to the sea and Oeneon in Locris, whence they had set out.
Many of the allies were killed, and about one hundred and twenty
Athenian heavy infantry, not a man less, and all in the prime of life.
These were by far the best men in the city of Athens that fell during
this war. Among the slain was also Procles, the colleague of
Demosthenes. Meanwhile the Athenians took up their dead under truce
from the Aetolians, and retired to Naupactus, and from thence went in
their ships to Athens; Demosthenes staying behind in Naupactus and in
the neighbourhood, being afraid to face the Athenians after the
disaster.

About the same time the Athenians on the coast of Sicily sailed to
Locris, and in a descent which they made from the ships defeated the
Locrians who came against them, and took a fort upon the river Halex.

The same summer the Aetolians, who before the Athenian expedition had
sent an embassy to Corinth and Lacedaemon, composed of Tolophus, an
Ophionian, Boriades, an Eurytanian, and Tisander, an Apodotian,
obtained that an army should be sent them against Naupactus, which had
invited the Athenian invasion. The Lacedaemonians accordingly sent off
towards autumn three thousand heavy infantry of the allies, five
hundred of whom were from Heraclea, the newly founded city in Trachis,
under the command of Eurylochus, a Spartan, accompanied by Macarius and
Menedaius, also Spartans.

The army having assembled at Delphi, Eurylochus sent a herald to the
Ozolian Locrians; the road to Naupactus lying through their territory,
and he having besides conceived the idea of detaching them from Athens.
His chief abettors in Locris were the Amphissians, who were alarmed at
the hostility of the Phocians. These first gave hostages themselves,
and induced the rest to do the same for fear of the invading army;
first, their neighbours the Myonians, who held the most difficult of
the passes, and after them the Ipnians, Messapians, Tritaeans,
Chalaeans, Tolophonians, Hessians, and Oeanthians, all of whom joined
in the expedition; the Olpaeans contenting themselves with giving
hostages, without accompanying the invasion; and the Hyaeans refusing
to do either, until the capture of Polis, one of their villages.

His preparations completed, Eurylochus lodged the hostages in Kytinium,
in Doris, and advanced upon Naupactus through the country of the
Locrians, taking upon his way Oeneon and Eupalium, two of their towns
that refused to join him. Arrived in the Naupactian territory, and
having been now joined by the Aetolians, the army laid waste the land
and took the suburb of the town, which was unfortified; and after this
Molycrium also, a Corinthian colony subject to Athens. Meanwhile the
Athenian Demosthenes, who since the affair in Aetolia had remained near
Naupactus, having had notice of the army and fearing for the town, went
and persuaded the Acarnanians, although not without difficulty because
of his departure from Leucas, to go to the relief of Naupactus. They
accordingly sent with him on board his ships a thousand heavy infantry,
who threw themselves into the place and saved it; the extent of its
wall and the small number of its defenders otherwise placing it in the
greatest danger. Meanwhile Eurylochus and his companions, finding that
this force had entered and that it was impossible to storm the town,
withdrew, not to Peloponnese, but to the country once called Aeolis,
and now Calydon and Pleuron, and to the places in that neighbourhood,
and Proschium in Aetolia; the Ambraciots having come and urged them to
combine with them in attacking Amphilochian Argos and the rest of
Amphilochia and Acarnania; affirming that the conquest of these
countries would bring all the continent into alliance with Lacedaemon.
To this Eurylochus consented, and dismissing the Aetolians, now
remained quiet with his army in those parts, until the time should come
for the Ambraciots to take the field, and for him to join them before
Argos.

Summer was now over. The winter ensuing, the Athenians in Sicily with
their Hellenic allies, and such of the Sicel subjects or allies of
Syracuse as had revolted from her and joined their army, marched
against the Sicel town Inessa, the acropolis of which was held by the
Syracusans, and after attacking it without being able to take it,
retired. In the retreat, the allies retreating after the Athenians were
attacked by the Syracusans from the fort, and a large part of their
army routed with great slaughter. After this, Laches and the Athenians
from the ships made some descents in Locris, and defeating the
Locrians, who came against them with Proxenus, son of Capaton, upon the
river Caicinus, took some arms and departed.

The same winter the Athenians purified Delos, in compliance, it
appears, with a certain oracle. It had been purified before by
Pisistratus the tyrant; not indeed the whole island, but as much of it
as could be seen from the temple. All of it was, however, now purified
in the following way. All the sepulchres of those that had died in
Delos were taken up, and for the future it was commanded that no one
should be allowed either to die or to give birth to a child in the
island; but that they should be carried over to Rhenea, which is so
near to Delos that Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, having added Rhenea to
his other island conquests during his period of naval ascendancy,
dedicated it to the Delian Apollo by binding it to Delos with a chain.

The Athenians, after the purification, celebrated, for the first time,
the quinquennial festival of the Delian games. Once upon a time,
indeed, there was a great assemblage of the Ionians and the
neighbouring islanders at Delos, who used to come to the festival, as
the Ionians now do to that of Ephesus, and athletic and poetical
contests took place there, and the cities brought choirs of dancers.
Nothing can be clearer on this point than the following verses of
Homer, taken from a hymn to Apollo:

Phœbus, wherever thou strayest, far or near,
Delos was still of all thy haunts most dear.
Thither the robed Ionians take their way
With wife and child to keep thy holiday,
Invoke thy favour on each manly game,
And dance and sing in honour of thy name.


That there was also a poetical contest in which the Ionians went to
contend, again is shown by the following, taken from the same hymn.
After celebrating the Delian dance of the women, he ends his song of
praise with these verses, in which he also alludes to himself:

Well, may Apollo keep you all! and so,
Sweethearts, good-bye—yet tell me not I go
Out from your hearts; and if in after hours
Some other wanderer in this world of ours
Touch at your shores, and ask your maidens here
Who sings the songs the sweetest to your ear,
Think of me then, and answer with a smile,
‘A blind old man of Scio’s rocky isle.’


Homer thus attests that there was anciently a great assembly and
festival at Delos. In later times, although the islanders and the
Athenians continued to send the choirs of dancers with sacrifices, the
contests and most of the ceremonies were abolished, probably through
adversity, until the Athenians celebrated the games upon this occasion
with the novelty of horse-races.

The same winter the Ambraciots, as they had promised Eurylochus when
they retained his army, marched out against Amphilochian Argos with
three thousand heavy infantry, and invading the Argive territory
occupied Olpae, a stronghold on a hill near the sea, which had been
formerly fortified by the Acarnanians and used as the place of assizes
for their nation, and which is about two miles and three-quarters from
the city of Argos upon the sea-coast. Meanwhile the Acarnanians went
with a part of their forces to the relief of Argos, and with the rest
encamped in Amphilochia at the place called Crenae, or the Wells, to
watch for Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, and to prevent their
passing through and effecting their junction with the Ambraciots; while
they also sent for Demosthenes, the commander of the Aetolian
expedition, to be their leader, and for the twenty Athenian ships that
were cruising off Peloponnese under the command of Aristotle, son of
Timocrates, and Hierophon, son of Antimnestus. On their part, the
Ambraciots at Olpae sent a messenger to their own city, to beg them to
come with their whole levy to their assistance, fearing that the army
of Eurylochus might not be able to pass through the Acarnanians, and
that they might themselves be obliged to fight single-handed, or be
unable to retreat, if they wished it, without danger.

Meanwhile Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, learning that the
Ambraciots at Olpae had arrived, set out from Proschium with all haste
to join them, and crossing the Achelous advanced through Acarnania,
which they found deserted by its population, who had gone to the relief
of Argos; keeping on their right the city of the Stratians and its
garrison, and on their left the rest of Acarnania. Traversing the
territory of the Stratians, they advanced through Phytia, next,
skirting Medeon, through Limnaea; after which they left Acarnania
behind them and entered a friendly country, that of the Agraeans. From
thence they reached and crossed Mount Thymaus, which belongs to the
Agraeans, and descended into the Argive territory after nightfall, and
passing between the city of Argos and the Acarnanian posts at Crenae,
joined the Ambraciots at Olpae.

Uniting here at daybreak, they sat down at the place called Metropolis,
and encamped. Not long afterwards the Athenians in the twenty ships
came into the Ambracian Gulf to support the Argives, with Demosthenes
and two hundred Messenian heavy infantry, and sixty Athenian archers.
While the fleet off Olpae blockaded the hill from the sea, the
Acarnanians and a few of the Amphilochians, most of whom were kept back
by force by the Ambraciots, had already arrived at Argos, and were
preparing to give battle to the enemy, having chosen Demosthenes to
command the whole of the allied army in concert with their own
generals. Demosthenes led them near to Olpae and encamped, a great
ravine separating the two armies. During five days they remained
inactive; on the sixth both sides formed in order of battle. The army
of the Peloponnesians was the largest and outflanked their opponents;
and Demosthenes fearing that his right might be surrounded, placed in
ambush in a hollow way overgrown with bushes some four hundred heavy
infantry and light troops, who were to rise up at the moment of the
onset behind the projecting left wing of the enemy, and to take them in
the rear. When both sides were ready they joined battle; Demosthenes
being on the right wing with the Messenians and a few Athenians, while
the rest of the line was made up of the different divisions of the
Acarnanians, and of the Amphilochian carters. The Peloponnesians and
Ambraciots were drawn up pell-mell together, with the exception of the
Mantineans, who were massed on the left, without however reaching to
the extremity of the wing, where Eurylochus and his men confronted the
Messenians and Demosthenes.

The Peloponnesians were now well engaged and with their outflanking
wing were upon the point of turning their enemy’s right; when the
Acarnanians from the ambuscade set upon them from behind, and broke
them at the first attack, without their staying to resist; while the
panic into which they fell caused the flight of most of their army,
terrified beyond measure at seeing the division of Eurylochus and their
best troops cut to pieces. Most of the work was done by Demosthenes and
his Messenians, who were posted in this part of the field. Meanwhile
the Ambraciots (who are the best soldiers in those countries) and the
troops upon the right wing, defeated the division opposed to them and
pursued it to Argos. Returning from the pursuit, they found their main
body defeated; and hard pressed by the Acarnanians, with difficulty
made good their passage to Olpae, suffering heavy loss on the way, as
they dashed on without discipline or order, the Mantineans excepted,
who kept their ranks best of any in the army during the retreat.

The battle did not end until the evening. The next day Menedaius, who
on the death of Eurylochus and Macarius had succeeded to the sole
command, being at a loss after so signal a defeat how to stay and
sustain a siege, cut off as he was by land and by the Athenian fleet by
sea, and equally so how to retreat in safety, opened a parley with
Demosthenes and the Acarnanian generals for a truce and permission to
retreat, and at the same time for the recovery of the dead. The dead
they gave back to him, and setting up a trophy took up their own also
to the number of about three hundred. The retreat demanded they refused
publicly to the army; but permission to depart without delay was
secretly granted to the Mantineans and to Menedaius and the other
commanders and principal men of the Peloponnesians by Demosthenes and
his Acarnanian colleagues; who desired to strip the Ambraciots and the
mercenary host of foreigners of their supporters; and, above all, to
discredit the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians with the Hellenes in
those parts, as traitors and self-seekers.

While the enemy was taking up his dead and hastily burying them as he
could, and those who obtained permission were secretly planning their
retreat, word was brought to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians that the
Ambraciots from the city, in compliance with the first message from
Olpae, were on the march with their whole levy through Amphilochia to
join their countrymen at Olpae, knowing nothing of what had occurred.
Demosthenes prepared to march with his army against them, and meanwhile
sent on at once a strong division to beset the roads and occupy the
strong positions. In the meantime the Mantineans and others included in
the agreement went out under the pretence of gathering herbs and
firewood, and stole off by twos and threes, picking on the way the
things which they professed to have come out for, until they had gone
some distance from Olpae, when they quickened their pace. The
Ambraciots and such of the rest as had accompanied them in larger
parties, seeing them going on, pushed on in their turn, and began
running in order to catch them up. The Acarnanians at first thought
that all alike were departing without permission, and began to pursue
the Peloponnesians; and believing that they were being betrayed, even
threw a dart or two at some of their generals who tried to stop them
and told them that leave had been given. Eventually, however, they let
pass the Mantineans and Peloponnesians, and slew only the Ambraciots,
there being much dispute and difficulty in distinguishing whether a man
was an Ambraciot or a Peloponnesian. The number thus slain was about
two hundred; the rest escaped into the bordering territory of Agraea,
and found refuge with Salynthius, the friendly king of the Agraeans.

Meanwhile the Ambraciots from the city arrived at Idomene. Idomene
consists of two lofty hills, the higher of which the troops sent on by
Demosthenes succeeded in occupying after nightfall, unobserved by the
Ambraciots, who had meanwhile ascended the smaller and bivouacked under
it. After supper Demosthenes set out with the rest of the army, as soon
as it was evening; himself with half his force making for the pass, and
the remainder going by the Amphilochian hills. At dawn he fell upon the
Ambraciots while they were still abed, ignorant of what had passed, and
fully thinking that it was their own countrymen—Demosthenes having
purposely put the Messenians in front with orders to address them in
the Doric dialect, and thus to inspire confidence in the sentinels, who
would not be able to see them as it was still night. In this way he
routed their army as soon as he attacked it, slaying most of them where
they were, the rest breaking away in flight over the hills. The roads,
however, were already occupied, and while the Amphilochians knew their
own country, the Ambraciots were ignorant of it and could not tell
which way to turn, and had also heavy armour as against a light-armed
enemy, and so fell into ravines and into the ambushes which had been
set for them, and perished there. In their manifold efforts to escape
some even turned to the sea, which was not far off, and seeing the
Athenian ships coasting alongshore just while the action was going on,
swam off to them, thinking it better in the panic they were in, to
perish, if perish they must, by the hands of the Athenians, than by
those of the barbarous and detested Amphilochians. Of the large
Ambraciot force destroyed in this manner, a few only reached the city
in safety; while the Acarnanians, after stripping the dead and setting
up a trophy, returned to Argos.

The next day arrived a herald from the Ambraciots who had fled from
Olpae to the Agraeans, to ask leave to take up the dead that had fallen
after the first engagement, when they left the camp with the Mantineans
and their companions, without, like them, having had permission to do
so. At the sight of the arms of the Ambraciots from the city, the
herald was astonished at their number, knowing nothing of the disaster
and fancying that they were those of their own party. Some one asked
him what he was so astonished at, and how many of them had been killed,
fancying in his turn that this was the herald from the troops at
Idomene. He replied: “About two hundred”; upon which his interrogator
took him up, saying: “Why, the arms you see here are of more than a
thousand.” The herald replied: “Then they are not the arms of those who
fought with us?” The other answered: “Yes, they are, if at least you
fought at Idomene yesterday.” “But we fought with no one yesterday; but
the day before in the retreat.” “However that may be, we fought
yesterday with those who came to reinforce you from the city of the
Ambraciots.” When the herald heard this and knew that the reinforcement
from the city had been destroyed, he broke into wailing and, stunned at
the magnitude of the present evils, went away at once without having
performed his errand, or again asking for the dead bodies. Indeed, this
was by far the greatest disaster that befell any one Hellenic city in
an equal number of days during this war; and I have not set down the
number of the dead, because the amount stated seems so out of
proportion to the size of the city as to be incredible. In any case I
know that if the Acarnanians and Amphilochians had wished to take
Ambracia as the Athenians and Demosthenes advised, they would have done
so without a blow; as it was, they feared that if the Athenians had it
they would be worse neighbours to them than the present.

After this the Acarnanians allotted a third of the spoils to the
Athenians, and divided the rest among their own different towns. The
share of the Athenians was captured on the voyage home; the arms now
deposited in the Attic temples are three hundred panoplies, which the
Acarnanians set apart for Demosthenes, and which he brought to Athens
in person, his return to his country after the Aetolian disaster being
rendered less hazardous by this exploit. The Athenians in the twenty
ships also went off to Naupactus. The Acarnanians and Amphilochians,
after the departure of Demosthenes and the Athenians, granted the
Ambraciots and Peloponnesians who had taken refuge with Salynthius and
the Agraeans a free retreat from Oeniadae, to which place they had
removed from the country of Salynthius, and for the future concluded
with the Ambraciots a treaty and alliance for one hundred years, upon
the terms following. It was to be a defensive, not an offensive
alliance; the Ambraciots could not be required to march with the
Acarnanians against the Peloponnesians, nor the Acarnanians with the
Ambraciots against the Athenians; for the rest the Ambraciots were to
give up the places and hostages that they held of the Amphilochians,
and not to give help to Anactorium, which was at enmity with the
Acarnanians. With this arrangement they put an end to the war. After
this the Corinthians sent a garrison of their own citizens to Ambracia,
composed of three hundred heavy infantry, under the command of
Xenocleides, son of Euthycles, who reached their destination after a
difficult journey across the continent. Such was the history of the
affair of Ambracia.

The same winter the Athenians in Sicily made a descent from their ships
upon the territory of Himera, in concert with the Sicels, who had
invaded its borders from the interior, and also sailed to the islands
of Aeolus. Upon their return to Rhegium they found the Athenian
general, Pythodorus, son of Isolochus, come to supersede Laches in the
command of the fleet. The allies in Sicily had sailed to Athens and
induced the Athenians to send out more vessels to their assistance,
pointing out that the Syracusans who already commanded their land were
making efforts to get together a navy, to avoid being any longer
excluded from the sea by a few vessels. The Athenians proceeded to man
forty ships to send to them, thinking that the war in Sicily would thus
be the sooner ended, and also wishing to exercise their navy. One of
the generals, Pythodorus, was accordingly sent out with a few ships;
Sophocles, son of Sostratides, and Eurymedon, son of Thucles, being
destined to follow with the main body. Meanwhile Pythodorus had taken
the command of Laches’ ships, and towards the end of winter sailed
against the Locrian fort, which Laches had formerly taken, and returned
after being defeated in battle by the Locrians.

In the first days of this spring, the stream of fire issued from Etna,
as on former occasions, and destroyed some land of the Catanians, who
live upon Mount Etna, which is the largest mountain in Sicily. Fifty
years, it is said, had elapsed since the last eruption, there having
been three in all since the Hellenes have inhabited Sicily. Such were
the events of this winter; and with it ended the sixth year of this
war, of which Thucydides was the historian.

CHAPTER XII


Seventh Year of the War—Occupation of Pylos—Surrender of the Spartan
Army in Sphacteria


Next summer, about the time of the corn’s coming into ear, ten
Syracusan and as many Locrian vessels sailed to Messina, in Sicily, and
occupied the town upon the invitation of the inhabitants; and Messina
revolted from the Athenians. The Syracusans contrived this chiefly
because they saw that the place afforded an approach to Sicily, and
feared that the Athenians might hereafter use it as a base for
attacking them with a larger force; the Locrians because they wished to
carry on hostilities from both sides of the strait and to reduce their
enemies, the people of Rhegium. Meanwhile, the Locrians had invaded the
Rhegian territory with all their forces, to prevent their succouring
Messina, and also at the instance of some exiles from Rhegium who were
with them; the long factions by which that town had been torn rendering
it for the moment incapable of resistance, and thus furnishing an
additional temptation to the invaders. After devastating the country
the Locrian land forces retired, their ships remaining to guard
Messina, while others were being manned for the same destination to
carry on the war from thence.

About the same time in the spring, before the corn was ripe, the
Peloponnesians and their allies invaded Attica under Agis, the son of
Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and laid waste the
country. Meanwhile the Athenians sent off the forty ships which they
had been preparing to Sicily, with the remaining generals Eurymedon and
Sophocles; their colleague Pythodorus having already preceded them
thither. These had also instructions as they sailed by to look to the
Corcyraeans in the town, who were being plundered by the exiles in the
mountain. To support these exiles sixty Peloponnesian vessels had
lately sailed, it being thought that the famine raging in the city
would make it easy for them to reduce it. Demosthenes also, who had
remained without employment since his return from Acarnania, applied
and obtained permission to use the fleet, if he wished it, upon the
coast of Peloponnese.

Off Laconia they heard that the Peloponnesian ships were already at
Corcyra, upon which Eurymedon and Sophocles wished to hasten to the
island, but Demosthenes required them first to touch at Pylos and do
what was wanted there, before continuing their voyage. While they were
making objections, a squall chanced to come on and carried the fleet
into Pylos. Demosthenes at once urged them to fortify the place, it
being for this that he had come on the voyage, and made them observe
there was plenty of stone and timber on the spot, and that the place
was strong by nature, and together with much of the country round
unoccupied; Pylos, or Coryphasium, as the Lacedaemonians call it, being
about forty-five miles distant from Sparta, and situated in the old
country of the Messenians. The commanders told him that there was no
lack of desert headlands in Peloponnese if he wished to put the city to
expense by occupying them. He, however, thought that this place was
distinguished from others of the kind by having a harbour close by;
while the Messenians, the old natives of the country, speaking the same
dialect as the Lacedaemonians, could do them the greatest mischief by
their incursions from it, and would at the same time be a trusty
garrison.

After speaking to the captains of companies on the subject, and failing
to persuade either the generals or the soldiers, he remained inactive
with the rest from stress of weather; until the soldiers themselves
wanting occupation were seized with a sudden impulse to go round and
fortify the place. Accordingly they set to work in earnest, and having
no iron tools, picked up stones, and put them together as they happened
to fit, and where mortar was needed, carried it on their backs for want
of hods, stooping down to make it stay on, and clasping their hands
together behind to prevent it falling off; sparing no effort to be able
to complete the most vulnerable points before the arrival of the
Lacedaemonians, most of the place being sufficiently strong by nature
without further fortifications.

Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians were celebrating a festival, and also at
first made light of the news, in the idea that whenever they chose to
take the field the place would be immediately evacuated by the enemy or
easily taken by force; the absence of their army before Athens having
also something to do with their delay. The Athenians fortified the
place on the land side, and where it most required it, in six days, and
leaving Demosthenes with five ships to garrison it, with the main body
of the fleet hastened on their voyage to Corcyra and Sicily.

As soon as the Peloponnesians in Attica heard of the occupation of
Pylos, they hurried back home; the Lacedaemonians and their king Agis
thinking that the matter touched them nearly. Besides having made their
invasion early in the season, and while the corn was still green, most
of their troops were short of provisions: the weather also was
unusually bad for the time of year, and greatly distressed their army.
Many reasons thus combined to hasten their departure and to make this
invasion a very short one; indeed they only stayed fifteen days in
Attica.

About the same time the Athenian general Simonides getting together a
few Athenians from the garrisons, and a number of the allies in those
parts, took Eion in Thrace, a Mendaean colony and hostile to Athens, by
treachery, but had no sooner done so than the Chalcidians and
Bottiaeans came up and beat him out of it, with the loss of many of his
soldiers.

On the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica, the Spartans
themselves and the nearest of the Perioeci at once set out for Pylos,
the other Lacedaemonians following more slowly, as they had just come
in from another campaign. Word was also sent round Peloponnese to come
up as quickly as possible to Pylos; while the sixty Peloponnesian ships
were sent for from Corcyra, and being dragged by their crews across the
isthmus of Leucas, passed unperceived by the Athenian squadron at
Zacynthus, and reached Pylos, where the land forces had arrived before
them. Before the Peloponnesian fleet sailed in, Demosthenes found time
to send out unobserved two ships to inform Eurymedon and the Athenians
on board the fleet at Zacynthus of the danger of Pylos and to summon
them to his assistance. While the ships hastened on their voyage in
obedience to the orders of Demosthenes, the Lacedaemonians prepared to
assault the fort by land and sea, hoping to capture with ease a work
constructed in haste, and held by a feeble garrison. Meanwhile, as they
expected the Athenian ships to arrive from Zacynthus, they intended, if
they failed to take the place before, to block up the entrances of the
harbour to prevent their being able to anchor inside it. For the island
of Sphacteria, stretching along in a line close in front of the
harbour, at once makes it safe and narrows its entrances, leaving a
passage for two ships on the side nearest Pylos and the Athenian
fortifications, and for eight or nine on that next the rest of the
mainland: for the rest, the island was entirely covered with wood, and
without paths through not being inhabited, and about one mile and five
furlongs in length. The inlets the Lacedaemonians meant to close with a
line of ships placed close together, with their prows turned towards
the sea, and, meanwhile, fearing that the enemy might make use of the
island to operate against them, carried over some heavy infantry
thither, stationing others along the coast. By this means the island
and the continent would be alike hostile to the Athenians, as they
would be unable to land on either; and the shore of Pylos itself
outside the inlet towards the open sea having no harbour, and,
therefore, presenting no point which they could use as a base to
relieve their countrymen, they, the Lacedaemonians, without sea-fight
or risk would in all probability become masters of the place, occupied
as it had been on the spur of the moment, and unfurnished with
provisions. This being determined, they carried over to the island the
heavy infantry, drafted by lot from all the companies. Some others had
crossed over before in relief parties, but these last who were left
there were four hundred and twenty in number, with their Helot
attendants, commanded by Epitadas, son of Molobrus.

Meanwhile Demosthenes, seeing the Lacedaemonians about to attack him by
sea and land at once, himself was not idle. He drew up under the
fortification and enclosed in a stockade the galleys remaining to him
of those which had been left him, arming the sailors taken out of them
with poor shields made most of them of osier, it being impossible to
procure arms in such a desert place, and even these having been
obtained from a thirty-oared Messenian privateer and a boat belonging
to some Messenians who happened to have come to them. Among these
Messenians were forty heavy infantry, whom he made use of with the
rest. Posting most of his men, unarmed and armed, upon the best
fortified and strong points of the place towards the interior, with
orders to repel any attack of the land forces, he picked sixty heavy
infantry and a few archers from his whole force, and with these went
outside the wall down to the sea, where he thought that the enemy would
most likely attempt to land. Although the ground was difficult and
rocky, looking towards the open sea, the fact that this was the weakest
part of the wall would, he thought, encourage their ardour, as the
Athenians, confident in their naval superiority, had here paid little
attention to their defences, and the enemy if he could force a landing
might feel secure of taking the place. At this point, accordingly,
going down to the water’s edge, he posted his heavy infantry to
prevent, if possible, a landing, and encouraged them in the following
terms:

“Soldiers and comrades in this adventure, I hope that none of you in
our present strait will think to show his wit by exactly calculating
all the perils that encompass us, but that you will rather hasten to
close with the enemy, without staying to count the odds, seeing in this
your best chance of safety. In emergencies like ours calculation is out
of place; the sooner the danger is faced the better. To my mind also
most of the chances are for us, if we will only stand fast and not
throw away our advantages, overawed by the numbers of the enemy. One of
the points in our favour is the awkwardness of the landing. This,
however, only helps us if we stand our ground. If we give way it will
be practicable enough, in spite of its natural difficulty, without a
defender; and the enemy will instantly become more formidable from the
difficulty he will have in retreating, supposing that we succeed in
repulsing him, which we shall find it easier to do, while he is on
board his ships, than after he has landed and meets us on equal terms.
As to his numbers, these need not too much alarm you. Large as they may
be he can only engage in small detachments, from the impossibility of
bringing to. Besides, the numerical superiority that we have to meet is
not that of an army on land with everything else equal, but of troops
on board ship, upon an element where many favourable accidents are
required to act with effect. I therefore consider that his difficulties
may be fairly set against our numerical deficiencies, and at the same
time I charge you, as Athenians who know by experience what landing
from ships on a hostile territory means, and how impossible it is to
drive back an enemy determined enough to stand his ground and not to be
frightened away by the surf and the terrors of the ships sailing in, to
stand fast in the present emergency, beat back the enemy at the water’s
edge, and save yourselves and the place.”

Thus encouraged by Demosthenes, the Athenians felt more confident, and
went down to meet the enemy, posting themselves along the edge of the
sea. The Lacedaemonians now put themselves in movement and
simultaneously assaulted the fortification with their land forces and
with their ships, forty-three in number, under their admiral,
Thrasymelidas, son of Cratesicles, a Spartan, who made his attack just
where Demosthenes expected. The Athenians had thus to defend themselves
on both sides, from the land and from the sea; the enemy rowing up in
small detachments, the one relieving the other—it being impossible for
many to bring to at once—and showing great ardour and cheering each
other on, in the endeavour to force a passage and to take the
fortification. He who most distinguished himself was Brasidas. Captain
of a galley, and seeing that the captains and steersmen, impressed by
the difficulty of the position, hung back even where a landing might
have seemed possible, for fear of wrecking their vessels, he shouted
out to them, that they must never allow the enemy to fortify himself in
their country for the sake of saving timber, but must shiver their
vessels and force a landing; and bade the allies, instead of hesitating
in such a moment to sacrifice their ships for Lacedaemon in return for
her many benefits, to run them boldly aground, land in one way or
another, and make themselves masters of the place and its garrison.

Not content with this exhortation, he forced his own steersman to run
his ship ashore, and stepping on to the gangway, was endeavouring to
land, when he was cut down by the Athenians, and after receiving many
wounds fainted away. Falling into the bows, his shield slipped off his
arm into the sea, and being thrown ashore was picked up by the
Athenians, and afterwards used for the trophy which they set up for
this attack. The rest also did their best, but were not able to land,
owing to the difficulty of the ground and the unflinching tenacity of
the Athenians. It was a strange reversal of the order of things for
Athenians to be fighting from the land, and from Laconian land too,
against Lacedaemonians coming from the sea; while Lacedaemonians were
trying to land from shipboard in their own country, now become hostile,
to attack Athenians, although the former were chiefly famous at the
time as an inland people and superior by land, the latter as a maritime
people with a navy that had no equal.

After continuing their attacks during that day and most of the next,
the Peloponnesians desisted, and the day after sent some of their ships
to Asine for timber to make engines, hoping to take by their aid, in
spite of its height, the wall opposite the harbour, where the landing
was easiest. At this moment the Athenian fleet from Zacynthus arrived,
now numbering fifty sail, having been reinforced by some of the ships
on guard at Naupactus and by four Chian vessels. Seeing the coast and
the island both crowded with heavy infantry, and the hostile ships in
harbour showing no signs of sailing out, at a loss where to anchor,
they sailed for the moment to the desert island of Prote, not far off,
where they passed the night. The next day they got under way in
readiness to engage in the open sea if the enemy chose to put out to
meet them, being determined in the event of his not doing so to sail in
and attack him. The Lacedaemonians did not put out to sea, and having
omitted to close the inlets as they had intended, remained quiet on
shore, engaged in manning their ships and getting ready, in the case of
any one sailing in, to fight in the harbour, which is a fairly large
one.

Perceiving this, the Athenians advanced against them by each inlet, and
falling on the enemy’s fleet, most of which was by this time afloat and
in line, at once put it to flight, and giving chase as far as the short
distance allowed, disabled a good many vessels and took five, one with
its crew on board; dashing in at the rest that had taken refuge on
shore, and battering some that were still being manned, before they
could put out, and lashing on to their own ships and towing off empty
others whose crews had fled. At this sight the Lacedaemonians, maddened
by a disaster which cut off their men on the island, rushed to the
rescue, and going into the sea with their heavy armour, laid hold of
the ships and tried to drag them back, each man thinking that success
depended on his individual exertions. Great was the melee, and quite in
contradiction to the naval tactics usual to the two combatants; the
Lacedaemonians in their excitement and dismay being actually engaged in
a sea-fight on land, while the victorious Athenians, in their eagerness
to push their success as far as possible, were carrying on a land-fight
from their ships. After great exertions and numerous wounds on both
sides they separated, the Lacedaemonians saving their empty ships,
except those first taken; and both parties returning to their camp, the
Athenians set up a trophy, gave back the dead, secured the wrecks, and
at once began to cruise round and jealously watch the island, with its
intercepted garrison, while the Peloponnesians on the mainland, whose
contingents had now all come up, stayed where they were before Pylos.

When the news of what had happened at Pylos reached Sparta, the
disaster was thought so serious that the Lacedaemonians resolved that
the authorities should go down to the camp, and decide on the spot what
was best to be done. There, seeing that it was impossible to help their
men, and not wishing to risk their being reduced by hunger or
overpowered by numbers, they determined, with the consent of the
Athenian generals, to conclude an armistice at Pylos and send envoys to
Athens to obtain a convention, and to endeavour to get back their men
as quickly as possible.

The generals accepting their offers, an armistice was concluded upon
the terms following:

That the Lacedaemonians should bring to Pylos and deliver up to the
Athenians the ships that had fought in the late engagement, and all in
Laconia that were vessels of war, and should make no attack on the
fortification either by land or by sea.

That the Athenians should allow the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to
send to the men in the island a certain fixed quantity of corn ready
kneaded, that is to say, two quarts of barley meal, one pint of wine,
and a piece of meat for each man, and half the same quantity for a
servant.

That this allowance should be sent in under the eyes of the Athenians,
and that no boat should sail to the island except openly.

That the Athenians should continue to the island same as before,
without however landing upon it, and should refrain from attacking the
Peloponnesian troops either by land or by sea.

That if either party should infringe any of these terms in the
slightest particular, the armistice should be at once void.

That the armistice should hold good until the return of the
Lacedaemonian envoys from Athens—the Athenians sending them thither in
a galley and bringing them back again—and upon the arrival of the
envoys should be at an end, and the ships be restored by the Athenians
in the same state as they received them.

Such were the terms of the armistice, and the ships were delivered over
to the number of sixty, and the envoys sent off accordingly. Arrived at
Athens they spoke as follows:

“Athenians, the Lacedaemonians sent us to try to find some way of
settling the affair of our men on the island, that shall be at once
satisfactory to our interests, and as consistent with our dignity in
our misfortune as circumstances permit. We can venture to speak at some
length without any departure from the habit of our country. Men of few
words where many are not wanted, we can be less brief when there is a
matter of importance to be illustrated and an end to be served by its
illustration. Meanwhile we beg you to take what we may say, not in a
hostile spirit, nor as if we thought you ignorant and wished to lecture
you, but rather as a suggestion on the best course to be taken,
addressed to intelligent judges. You can now, if you choose, employ
your present success to advantage, so as to keep what you have got and
gain honour and reputation besides, and you can avoid the mistake of
those who meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune, and are led
on by hope to grasp continually at something further, through having
already succeeded without expecting it. While those who have known most
vicissitudes of good and bad, have also justly least faith in their
prosperity; and to teach your city and ours this lesson experience has
not been wanting.

“To be convinced of this you have only to look at our present
misfortune. What power in Hellas stood higher than we did? and yet we
are come to you, although we formerly thought ourselves more able to
grant what we are now here to ask. Nevertheless, we have not been
brought to this by any decay in our power, or through having our heads
turned by aggrandizement; no, our resources are what they have always
been, and our error has been an error of judgment, to which all are
equally liable. Accordingly, the prosperity which your city now enjoys,
and the accession that it has lately received, must not make you fancy
that fortune will be always with you. Indeed sensible men are prudent
enough to treat their gains as precarious, just as they would also keep
a clear head in adversity, and think that war, so far from staying
within the limit to which a combatant may wish to confine it, will run
the course that its chances prescribe; and thus, not being puffed up by
confidence in military success, they are less likely to come to grief,
and most ready to make peace, if they can, while their fortune lasts.
This, Athenians, you have a good opportunity to do now with us, and
thus to escape the possible disasters which may follow upon your
refusal, and the consequent imputation of having owed to accident even
your present advantages, when you might have left behind you a
reputation for power and wisdom which nothing could endanger.

“The Lacedaemonians accordingly invite you to make a treaty and to end
the war, and offer peace and alliance and the most friendly and
intimate relations in every way and on every occasion between us; and
in return ask for the men on the island, thinking it better for both
parties not to stand out to the end, on the chance of some favourable
accident enabling the men to force their way out, or of their being
compelled to succumb under the pressure of blockade. Indeed if great
enmities are ever to be really settled, we think it will be, not by the
system of revenge and military success, and by forcing an opponent to
swear to a treaty to his disadvantage, but when the more fortunate
combatant waives these his privileges, to be guided by gentler feelings
conquers his rival in generosity, and accords peace on more moderate
conditions than he expected. From that moment, instead of the debt of
revenge which violence must entail, his adversary owes a debt of
generosity to be paid in kind, and is inclined by honour to stand to
his agreement. And men oftener act in this manner towards their
greatest enemies than where the quarrel is of less importance; they are
also by nature as glad to give way to those who first yield to them, as
they are apt to be provoked by arrogance to risks condemned by their
own judgment.

“To apply this to ourselves: if peace was ever desirable for both
parties, it is surely so at the present moment, before anything
irremediable befall us and force us to hate you eternally, personally
as well as politically, and you to miss the advantages that we now
offer you. While the issue is still in doubt, and you have reputation
and our friendship in prospect, and we the compromise of our misfortune
before anything fatal occur, let us be reconciled, and for ourselves
choose peace instead of war, and grant to the rest of the Hellenes a
remission from their sufferings, for which be sure they will think they
have chiefly you to thank. The war that they labour under they know not
which began, but the peace that concludes it, as it depends on your
decision, will by their gratitude be laid to your door. By such a
decision you can become firm friends with the Lacedaemonians at their
own invitation, which you do not force from them, but oblige them by
accepting. And from this friendship consider the advantages that are
likely to follow: when Attica and Sparta are at one, the rest of
Hellas, be sure, will remain in respectful inferiority before its
heads.”

Such were the words of the Lacedaemonians, their idea being that the
Athenians, already desirous of a truce and only kept back by their
opposition, would joyfully accept a peace freely offered, and give back
the men. The Athenians, however, having the men on the island, thought
that the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it,
and grasped at something further. Foremost to encourage them in this
policy was Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, a popular leader of the time and
very powerful with the multitude, who persuaded them to answer as
follows: First, the men in the island must surrender themselves and
their arms and be brought to Athens. Next, the Lacedaemonians must
restore Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia, all places acquired not by
arms, but by the previous convention, under which they had been ceded
by Athens herself at a moment of disaster, when a truce was more
necessary to her than at present. This done they might take back their
men, and make a truce for as long as both parties might agree.

To this answer the envoys made no reply, but asked that commissioners
might be chosen with whom they might confer on each point, and quietly
talk the matter over and try to come to some agreement. Hereupon Cleon
violently assailed them, saying that he knew from the first that they
had no right intentions, and that it was clear enough now by their
refusing to speak before the people, and wanting to confer in secret
with a committee of two or three. No, if they meant anything honest let
them say it out before all. The Lacedaemonians, however, seeing that
whatever concessions they might be prepared to make in their
misfortune, it was impossible for them to speak before the multitude
and lose credit with their allies for a negotiation which might after
all miscarry, and on the other hand, that the Athenians would never
grant what they asked upon moderate terms, returned from Athens without
having effected anything.

Their arrival at once put an end to the armistice at Pylos, and the
Lacedaemonians asked back their ships according to the convention. The
Athenians, however, alleged an attack on the fort in contravention of
the truce, and other grievances seemingly not worth mentioning, and
refused to give them back, insisting upon the clause by which the
slightest infringement made the armistice void. The Lacedaemonians,
after denying the contravention and protesting against their bad faith
in the matter of the ships, went away and earnestly addressed
themselves to the war. Hostilities were now carried on at Pylos upon
both sides with vigour. The Athenians cruised round the island all day
with two ships going different ways; and by night, except on the
seaward side in windy weather, anchored round it with their whole
fleet, which, having been reinforced by twenty ships from Athens come
to aid in the blockade, now numbered seventy sail; while the
Peloponnesians remained encamped on the continent, making attacks on
the fort, and on the look-out for any opportunity which might offer
itself for the deliverance of their men.

Meanwhile the Syracusans and their allies in Sicily had brought up to
the squadron guarding Messina the reinforcement which we left them
preparing, and carried on the war from thence, incited chiefly by the
Locrians from hatred of the Rhegians, whose territory they had invaded
with all their forces. The Syracusans also wished to try their fortune
at sea, seeing that the Athenians had only a few ships actually at
Rhegium, and hearing that the main fleet destined to join them was
engaged in blockading the island. A naval victory, they thought, would
enable them to blockade Rhegium by sea and land, and easily to reduce
it; a success which would at once place their affairs upon a solid
basis, the promontory of Rhegium in Ital
